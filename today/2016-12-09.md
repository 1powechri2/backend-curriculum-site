## Gear Up (1:15 - 2:15)
We will discuss ["Microaggressions"](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions.markdown) at Blake and Gusto. Students will need to **self-select** into one of the following topics and show up at the corresponding location.

**1. Microaggressions 101 (GUSTO):** Learn what a microaggression is, look at examples, and discuss what they mean for individuals and community. ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md))  

**2. Responding to Microaggressions (BLAKE):** What is within your sphere of control to reduce microaggressions in our community and address their consequences when they do occur? ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md))  

**3. Lived Experiences (BLAKE):** For those who’ve felt the effect of microaggressions to discuss the experience and what it’s meant to them. Listening to others share is a valid form of participation for this topic.  

Module 1 (BE/FE) will have their own Gear Up/Citizenship session at Guaranty Bank, S300. ([link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group3.md))
