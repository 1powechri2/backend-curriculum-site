### Building a Tiny Service (9:00 - 11:00)

### Mid-Module Diagnostic (11:00 - 5:00ish)

The deadline for your midmodule submission is loose. Try to only spend about 6 hours of work on it. If you'd like to take a break and work a little later that is fine.

We will look at your git logs to see your workflow and roughly the amount of time you spend on the assessment.

Spend no more than 8 hours on the assessment.
