## Learning Goals

* Describe flow integrating git and github  
* Describe how two people might work off the same repository
* Describe steps to resolving a merge conflict

## Structure

* 5   - Warmup
* 20  - Pairing Demonstration
* 5   - Break
* 25  - Resolve Merge Conflict Demonstration
* 5   - Closing/Synthesis

## WarmUp  
* What is git?  
* How does GitHub relate to git?  
* What are the steps to creating and interacting with a repo on GitHub? How is git involved?

## Modeling Workflow

### Git Flow for Pairs 101  
* Initialize repo locally  
* Create a repo on GitHub  
* Add remote to local  
* Commit and push  
* Add collaborator  
* Collaborator clones repo  
* Collaborator pulls from new repo  
* Collaborator changes current line of file  
* Collaborator commits and pushes to master   

### Merge Conflict Work Flow      
* Original pulls from master w/ present merge conflict    
* Original resolves merge conflict
* Original commits changes  
* Original pushes resolution to master  

### Optional: Work flow with branches  
* Collaborator pulls from master  
* Collaborator creates new branch 
* Collaborator adds content on new branch  
* Collaborator commits and pushes branch  
* Collaborator puts in a PR  
* Original merges branch to master  

## Closing  
Talk with partner
* What are the commands to do the following:
   - Create a repo  
   - Connect a git repo to a GitHub repo  
   - Update your local git with new content  
   - Update GitHub with new content  
* What steps would you take if working with a partner on a separate computer? What are the pros/cons of this work flow?
