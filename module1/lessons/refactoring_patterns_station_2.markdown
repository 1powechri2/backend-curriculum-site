# Pattern 2: Extract Class

## Supplies

* You should have a copy of
[this extraction of Chapter 7](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69001/Refactoring/Refactoring%20-%20Chapter%207.pdf).

## Instructions

* Read the Extract Class section from 175 to 179
* *Carefully* re-read the code sections on 177 and 178
* Read/discuss the Key Ideas below
* Try refactoring the Example Scenario below using Extract Class
* You're welcome to discuss / compare solutions with others
* If you finish early, read the Inline Class pattern (179-181)

## Key Ideas

* One of the most common weaknesses in object-oriented systems
* One object is doing the work of two (or more)
* Really is a "Step 1" before applying Move Method
* Extraction allows for easier testing, reuse, and abstraction

## Example Scenario
