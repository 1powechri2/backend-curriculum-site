# Credit Check Recheck

Credit Check once more!

By now, we should have a solid understanding of the algorithmic requirements behind solving Credit Check in Ruby.

Let's take our comfort with our solutions, toss them to the side, and start fresh by test-driving the development towards our solution.

## Setup

Within your projects directory, create a new directory called `credit_check_recheck`.

Leveraging your knowledge of Ruby project conventions, set yourself up with `lib/` and `test/` directories.

## TDD-ing

Do your best not to write any lines of source code without a test's error driving you to do so.

Using both unit and integration tests (predominantly unit tests), drive yourself to a modular, OOP Credit Check solution.

If you achieve this during our class time, do your best to revist your source code and make refactors to keep your code as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)-abiding as possible.

Remember, red, green, refactor, repeat.

> You may refer back to your first Credit Check solution, but refrain from copying any code from there to use in this solution.
