### Learning Goals 
*   define and apply the Move Method refactoring pattern
*   define and apply the Extract Class refactoring pattern
*   define and apply the Hide Delegate refactoring pattern

### Structure  
5min - WarmUp  
5min - Review
15min - Station Session 1  
15min - Station Session 2
15min - Station Session 3
5min - WrapUp

### WarmUp 
* What are your go-to refactoring strategies?   
* What are three reasons for refactoring your code?  

## Refactoring Strategies  
Three highlighted refactoring patterns from Jay Fields revised Fowler's book for Ruby:
[Refactoring: Ruby Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Edition-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321984137)    
1.  Move Method  
2.  Extract Class
3.  Hide Delegate

**Turn & Talk** 
What is the gist of each of these refactoring patterns? What are the pros/cons of each?  

### Stations  
You will spend 15 min at each station focusing on one of the strategies.  
For each station you will apply the refactoring pattern to the code from [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/refactoring_patterns) repo. Make sure to clone it down before you start.  
1.  [Move Method](refactoring_patterns_1)  
2.  [Extract Class](refactoring_patterns_2)  
3.  [Hide Delegate](refactoring_patterns_3)  

### WrapUp  
* What are some strategies to make sure that your code makes it from greed, past red, back to refactor again?  (a.k.a. how do you refactor without breaking everything?  
* What was challenging about refactoring the above exercises?  

#### Follow Up: Enigma Refactoring Exercises

Students should join a pair to work on applying these techniques to a sample Enigma project using [these exercises](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/enigma_refactoring_exercises).

##### Homework

*   Tonight you should watch [Katrina's Therapeutic Refactoring talk](http://confreaks.tv/videos/cascadiaruby2012-therapeutic-refactoring).
*   The readings we used today can be [found here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69001/Refactoring/Refactoring%20-%20Chapter%207.pdf). Read through the refactoring patterns not covered in this lesson.
