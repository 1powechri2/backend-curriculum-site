# Portfolio Guidelines

## Structure and Requirements
* Individual Assessment: Passing Score (All 3's) required
  * Your submitted portfolio should include **self-assessment** scores.
  * Use the [rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/rubric.markdown) to determine your proper scores.
* Final Assessments
  * Include scores and applicable notes for your written diagnostic.
  * Include scores and applicable notes for your paired assessment.
  * Include scores and applicable notes for your timed exercise.
* Individual Projects
  * Include scores for all individual projects.
* Group Projects: All paired projects
  * Include scores for all individual projects.
  * A passing final project is required.
* Professional Development:
  * [DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zMtgWhODQuP3KBNhrg6PtmPUkw0DIskqgggeyEzYZi4/edit?usp=sharing) from 1 paired project
  * Feedback
    * Self-solicited from pair project partners (paragraph each)
* Community
  * A recap of reflections from each Gear Up (paragraph)
  * Summary of how you've contributed to the community
* To Repeat the Module
  * A passing Chisel project completed during the final 2 weeks of the module **OR**
  * Satisfactory progress on the Headcount / Black Thursday final project.

## Filename & Directory

The file should be saved in the format `"date-name-completing.markdown"` where:

* `date` is the last day of the module in compressed year/month/day, like `20150831`
* `name` is your first and last name like `jeff-casimir`
* `completing` is the module that you're completing, like `m4`

So a complete filename might look like `20150831-jeff-casimir-m4.markdown`. This file needs to be stored in a directory `portfolios/students/your-cohort/your-name` where `your-name` is like `jeff-casimir` and `your-cohort` is your cohort number.

If you were completing Module 4 in Cohort 1410 on August 31, 2015 and your name was Jeff Casimir, your portfolio submission would reside at the following location: `portfolios/students/1410/jeff-casimir/20150831-jeff-casimir-m4.markdown`.

## Evaluation Process

* Your portfolio will be evaluated in the last week of the module.
* A pull request with your submission must be made at least 12 hours before your scheduled defense.
* Non-conforming formats, filenames, or directories will be rejected and your defense rescheduled.
* Instructors will review all portfolio submissions before your scheduled portfolio panel review and merge pull requests.
* During your portfolio defense, you will discuss:
  * Discrepancies (if any) between self-assessment scores and instructors' estimation of performance.
  * Areas in which your work did not meet expectations.
  * Areas of strength
  * Areas in which continued attention is warranted.
  * Provisional work, if applicable, to close out expectations for the module.
* Instructors will commit notes from the discussion to your portfolio and your final score will be used to rended a promotion/retained/excused/provisional outcome.

## Outcomes

Portfolio evaluations have four possible outcomes.

* *PROMOTED* - your portfolio demonstrates a successful fulfillment of expectations
and you may move on to the next module or graduate
* *RETAINED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and you may either
repeat the current module or leave the program
* *EXCUSED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and either (a) you've
now failed to pass the module in two attempts or (b) the reviewers have determined
that you will not be successful at Turing
* *PROVISIONAL* - your portfolio is incomplete or non-conforming and will be re-evaluated
as soon as possible. If it is incomplete after 24 hours it will be moved to *RETAINED* or *EXCUSED*
