## Pseudocoding Practice

In class we explored pseudocoding and why we might use it. The homework assignment is to look at [this](../challenges/bad_connection) exercise and use these questions to direct your thoughts:

1. How will you know when the problem is solved? (Identify the big-picture goal)
2. How do you want to use the software? (Identify the "interface")
3. What's the (next-)most trivial possible case? (Identify the next small-picture goal)
4. *How* do we achieve this goal? (Sketch an algorithm using pseudocode)

Create a folder in your module1 directory called "homework". Create a ruby file in the homework folder called "pseudocode.rb". Put your pseudocode in this file.
