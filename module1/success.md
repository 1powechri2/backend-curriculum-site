## Module 1 Learning Goals

A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.

#### Develop Proficiency in Ruby

*   Explain how basic data structures work and implement them in Ruby
*   Identify and apply best choice methods for strings, integers, collections
*   Consistently identify best-choice enumerables for interacting with collections
*   Use boolean operators, if/else statements, and loops to manage control flow
*   Use Ruby docs and other online documentation to identify best-choice methods and approaches
*   Speak clearly and accurately about OOP, language mechanics, and correctly name the elements of Ruby syntax
*   Define Application Program Interface (API), explain the difference between public versus private methods, and describe their meaning in the context of Ruby applications

#### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

*   Students can define ORM and implement the technique to develop a complex application
*   Students can import and export data to .csv and .txt files

#### Testing

*   Understand and describe why we test software
*   Understand and describe tests they did not write
*   Write unit and integration software tests
*   Translate specification requirements to tests that will drive design

#### Application Complexity

*   Students can develop complex algorithms and implement them in Ruby
*   Translate abstract requirements into programmable concepts using whiteboarding and pseudocode
*   Decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges

#### Debugging

*   Master debugging tools, mainly pry
*   Print to console to verify code behavior
*   Use pry or irb console sessions to test code tactics and address bugs
*   Demonstrate ability to choose appropriate debugging tactic to solve problems

#### Collaboration

*   Co-develop strategies to deal with logistics surrounding pair project work
*   Articulate personal and learning needs in a constructive, clear manner
*   Advocate for and co-create team dynamics that balance the learning goals of all team members
*   Resolve conflict when necessary during problematic team dynamics or project direction
*   Develop feedback (written and verbal) that is specific, actionable, and kind

#### Desktop Environment

*   Navigate machine to write, run, and test programs
*   Move between programs without relying on mouse
*   Make use of keyboard shortcuts to minimize distractions
*   Understand and explain how CLI, text editor and browser interact

#### Version Control

*   Understand gitâ€™s version control, both via the command line and through GitHub
*   Demonstrate version control proficiency by adding, committing, merging and pushing code changes, as well as switching branches and retrieving earlier commit history
*   Fork, clone, fetch, and making pull requests to facilitate collaboration
*   Describe differences between local versus remote repositories
