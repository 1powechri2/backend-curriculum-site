## Module 1 Learning Goals

Academic success in BEM1 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.

### Ruby Syntax & Style

#### Mastery

* Identify and apply best choice methods for strings, integers, arrays and hashes
* Consistently identify best-choice enumerables for interacting with arrays and hashes
* Use if/else statements, loops, conditional statements, and boolean operators to manage control flow
* Use Ruby docs and other online documentation to identify best-choice methods and approaches
* Explain the difference between class and instance methods

#### Functional

* Name and describe elements of Ruby Syntax
* Create and utilize modules to share code between classes
* Be able to inherit code from a superclass
* Import and export data to .csv and .txt files

### Breaking Logic Into Components

#### Mastery

* Translate abstract requirements into programmable concepts using whiteboarding and pseudocode
* Decompose large technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges
* Use abstraction to layer complexity
* Design classes and methods that have single responsibilities

#### Functional

* Write software that is testable at the unit level
* Write software with clear inputs and outputs
* Implement complex algorithms in Ruby

### Test Driven Development

#### Mastery

* Translate specification requirements to tests that will drive design
* Write unit and integration tests that accurately describe a program's expected functionality
* Understand and describe why we test software

#### Functional

* Understand and describe tests they did not write

### Debugging

#### Mastery

* Use debugging tools (e.g. `pry`) to help investigate assumptions and verify code behavior
* Print to console to verify code behavior
* Use pry or irb console sessions to test code tactics and address bugs
* Demonstrate ability to choose appropriate debugging tactic to solve problems

### Version Control

#### Mastery

* Understand gitâ€™s version control, both via the command line and through GitHub
* Demonstrate version control proficiency by adding, committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and branching
* Fork, clone, and make pull requests to facilitate collaboration
* Describe differences between local and remote repositories

#### Functional

* Checkout earlier versions of a repository
* Resolve merge conflicts

### Desktop Environment

#### Mastery

* Navigate machine to write and run programs
* Understand and explain how CLI, text editor, and finder interact

#### Functional

* Move between programs without relying on mouse
* Make use of keyboard shortcuts to minimize distractions
* Utilize a window manager to maintain a organized workspace

### Collaboration

#### Mastery

* Co-develop strategies to deal with logistics surrounding pair project work
* Resolve conflict when necessary during problematic team dynamics or project direction
* Develop feedback (written and verbal) that is specific, actionable, and kind

#### Functional

* Articulate personal and learning needs in a constructive, clear manner
* Advocate for and co-create team dynamics that balance the learning goals of all team members

### Career Development (Additional Details)

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
