subheading: Object Oriented Programming with Ruby
---

## Overview
In Module 1, students will learn to use Ruby and object-oriented programming to build software. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through several large group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers.


## Learning Goals
A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.

* Comfortably implement an object relational model
* Compose Ruby programs that manipulate objects using complex algorithms
* Explain how basic data structures work and implement them in Ruby
* Consistently demonstrate appropriate use of Ruby syntax
* Decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges
* Create software tests that will drive the design of applications
* Illustrate ideas and solutions using pseudocode
* Turn pseudocode into implementation code
* Write, run, and debug Ruby code
* Collaborate effectively with teammates
* Critique code in a specific, actionable, and kind way
* Demonstrate how to use GitHub for projects
* Explain how and why software is executed on a computer
* Speak fluently about technical topics
