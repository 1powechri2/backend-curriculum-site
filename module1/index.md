## Overview

In Module 1, students will learn to use Ruby and object-oriented programming to build software. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through several large group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers.

## Learning Goals
A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.

#### Develop proficiency in Ruby
*   Explain how basic data structures work and implement them in Ruby
*   Identify and apply best choice methods for strings, integers, collections
*   Consistently identify best-choice enumerables for interacting with collections
*   Use boolean operators, if/else statements, and loops to manage control flow
*   Use Ruby docs and other online documentation to identify best-choice methods and approaches
*   Speak clearly and accurately about OOP, language mechanics, and correctly name the elements of Ruby syntax
*   Define Application Program Interface (API), explain the difference between public versus private methods, and describe their meaning in the context of Ruby applications

#### Object-relational mapping (ORM)
*   Students can define ORM and implement the technique to develop a complex application
*   Students can import and export data to .csv and .txt files

#### Testing
*   Understand and describe why we test software
*   Understand and describe tests they did not write
*   Write unit and integration software tests
*   Translate specification requirements to tests that will drive design

#### Application complexity
*   Students can develop complex algorithms and implement them in Ruby
*   Translate abstract requirements into programmable concepts using whiteboarding and pseudocode
*   Decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges

#### Debugging
*   Master debugging tools, mainly pry
*   Print to console to verify code behavior
*   Use pry or irb console sessions to test code tactics and address bugs
*   Demonstrate ability to choose appropriate debugging tactic to solve problems

#### Collaboration
*   Co-develop strategies to deal with logistics surrounding pair project work
*   Articulate personal and learning needs in a constructive, clear manner
*   Advocate for and co-create team dynamics that balance the learning goals of all team members
*   Resolve conflict when necessary during problematic team dynamics or project direction
*   Develop feedback (written and verbal) that is specific, actionable, and kind

#### Desktop Environment
*   Navigate machine to write, run, and test programs
*   Move between programs without relying on mouse
*   Make use of keyboard shortcuts to minimize distractions
*   Understand and explain how CLI, text editor and browser interact

#### Version Control
*   Understand gitâ€™s version control, both via the command line and through GitHub
*   Demonstrate version control proficiency by adding, committing, merging and pushing code changes, as well as switching branches and retrieving earlier commit history
*   Fork, clone, fetch, and making pull requests to facilitate collaboration
*   Describe differences between local versus remote repositories
