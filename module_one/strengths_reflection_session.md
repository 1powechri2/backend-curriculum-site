### Objectives
* Understand how strengths are developed...

### Deliverable
Complete this [reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md) in your own gist and DM it to Allison. If you would like to schedule a coaching session with her, please indicate that in your DM to her. 

### What is a Strength?
The StrengthsFinder assessment doesn't measure strengths exactly -- instead, it's examining the presence of certain talents in 34 areas. Strengths are rather the product of building one's talents combined with skills and knowledge. Here is the breakdown of this development:

A **strength** is the ability to consistently produce a positive outcome through near-perfect performance in a specific task. Examples:

A strength is composed of:

* **Skills:** Your basic abilities to perform the fundamental steps of a task, such as your basic ability to move through the fundamental steps of operating a computer. Skills do not naturally exist within us; they must be acquired through formal or informal training and practice.
* **Knowledge:** Simply what you know, such as your awareness of historical dates and your grasp of the rules of a game. Knowledge does not naturally exist within us; it must be acquired through formal or informal education.
* **Talents:** The ways in which you naturally think, feel, and behave, such as the inner drive to compete, sensitivity to the needs of others, and the tendency to be outgoing at social gatherings. Although talents must come into existence naturally and cannot be acquired like skills and knowledge, we each have unique talents within us.

Because your most powerful talents represent the best of your natural self, they are your best opportunities to perform at levels of excellence and from which to build strengths.

* Your **dominant talents** naturally appear frequently and powerfully. Almost no matter where you are or what you are doing, your dominant talents are active.
* Your **supporting talents** naturally surface only when their support is needed, and do so with only relative power. Because they aren’t as powerful, your supporting talents are unlikely to serve as a foundation for strengths development.
* Your **lesser talents** naturally appear rarely, and they offer little power. Because of that minimal power, lesser talents seldom contribute to strengths development.

As Lee Saville (1608-BE) once said (and this is a paraphrase), strengths development is like looking at a landscape -- there are mountains, valleys, plateaus. We have access to all of our strengths, but they might be in different stages of development at a given time. 

### Building Your Strengths
To develop your strengths, start by looking at the top 5 talent themes that came up for you in your StrengthsFinder assessment. Which of them best describe your greatest talents — the ways in which you most consistently and productively think, feel, and behave?

These top 5 themes will be great resources 

### How to Use StrengthsFinder Results
Now that you have taken the StrengthsFinder assessment, let's dive into what the results mean. While

### Next Steps & Coaching
StrengthsFinder will continue to be a part of your career development at Turing...

Utilizing coaching is completely optional, and even if you don't want to participate in coaching this module, you can participate at any point during your time at Turing. 

**What is professional coaching?**

Coaching can be a helpful tool as students work to realize their own value both as a professional and as an individual as it provides a framework for students to develop themselves to their fullest potential. As a coach, Allison works to get to know students as individuals, helping to uncover their core values, strengths, and passions through discussion, guidance, and reflection. She acts as a thought partner in these discussions. Through coaching, students are able to cultivate a stronger sense of self, which leads them to achieving peak performance in both personal and professional goals.   

All coaching sessions are confidential. 

### Time for Reflection
Now, take the next 30-40 minutes to read through your results and [complete the reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md) to DM to Allison. If you'd like a follow-up meeting with Allison to discuss coaching around your goals, please indicate that in your message.
