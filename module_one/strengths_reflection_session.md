The StrengthsFinder assessment doesn't measure strengths exactly -- instead, it's examining the presence of certain talents in 34 areas. Strengths are rather the product of building one's talents combined with skills and knowledge. Here is the breakdown of this development:

A **strength** is the ability to consistently produce a positive outcome through near-perfect performance in a specific task. Examples:

A strength is composed of:

* Skills
* Knowledge
* Talents

As Lee Saville (1608-BE) once said (and this is a paraphrase), strengths are like a landscape -- there are mountains, valleys, plateaus. We have access to all of our strengths, but they might be in different stages of development at a given time.

**What is professional coaching?**

Coaching can be a helpful tool as students work to realize their own value both as a professional and as an individual as it provides a framework for students to develop themselves to their fullest potential. As a coach, Allison works to get to know students as individuals, helping to uncover their core values, strengths, and passions through discussion, guidance, and reflection. She acts as a thought partner in these discussions. Through coaching, students are able to cultivate a stronger sense of self, which leads them to achieving peak performance in both personal and professional goals.   

All coaching sessions are confidential.
