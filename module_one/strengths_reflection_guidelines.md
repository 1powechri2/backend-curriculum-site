# Strengths Reflection & Coaching Requests

1. Read through the definitions of the strengths from your report as well as the suggestions that StrengthsFinder provided for you. How would you define each of your top 5 strengths in your own words?


2. How have you seen yourself using these strengths?



3. How often do you use these strengths?



4. How could you use these strengths in new ways?
