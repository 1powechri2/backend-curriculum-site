#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
Part of connecting with others....

A long, long time from now, when you are ready to graduate, you will give a lightning talk about your experiences at Turing.  Today we are going to start that lightning talk by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish.  This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career. 

 What do you love about stories? Start talking about storytelling rules; Why is storytelling an important part of the transition to your new career?

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Quick Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people -- what was compelling about your partner's story?

### Individual Reflection -- ADD/CHANGE questions
Think about yourself as a compelling character...

In your journals, reflect on the following questions:

* What brought you here to Turing and this new career?  
* What lenses or identities do you view the world through most often?
* What are the values that drive you?
* How do you think you demonstrate those values to people around you?
* Could other people identify your values from your actions/words/presence? Why or why not?

### Small Group Share -- Telling story of how you got here and who you are

Students will get into groups of 4 to discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterrupted about the first two reflection questions). Assign someone to keep time. You will have additional time in your group after everyone shares. With that additional time, discuss your ideas for this final question:

* How can we operate as a cohort to build on our similarities and learn from our differences?

### Whole Group Share -- Possibly a different question

Each groups's presenter shares their groups discussion of "How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your cohort?" 

### Using Your Strengths in Your Story
Now think about how you've changed and developed since starting at Turing. How has your story changed? How does your development play a part in your story? How can you use your StrengthsFinder themes to tell your story?

Now we'll frame our stories around how we're developing at Turing.

#### I Do: Allison Models

#### Individual Reflection

* Look at your initial reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?

### Pair Up: Interviewing
Objective is to start telling your story
  4 mins to tell your story -- we want to get down to 2-3 mins but we're still practicing, so we'll take 4 mins this time

StrengthsFinder -- how does your development fit into your story at Turing? (6 mins intro -- I model; 6 mins reflection = 12 mins)
  Now we're 
  Individual reflection on your themes -- what progress have you made? How do these 5 pieces

### Interviewing

3 rounds




### (10 minutes) Prepare your slides

Prepare the slides that you will use for your final lightning talk.  In your notebooks, think about how you would design slides and what you would want to be on the slides.  There are three slides you should focus on at this time:

* Where are you from?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What do you hope to accomplish during your time here?

### (5 minutes) Closing

On graduation day, cohorts have the opportunity to share their reflections on their time here.  Over and over again, cohorts comment that they wish they had shared more of their stories sooner.  Cohorts comment that they wish they had spent more time understanding each other and what experiences brought each person here.  Consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks.  The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
