#### Hook: Storytelling Follow-Up
Last week, we spent time talking about our stories in terms of our identities, values, and strengths. Today, we'll practice storytelling in other contexts to dive into our developer identity.

**Pair & Share #1:** Find a partner for a 2-minute conversation. You'll describe yourself as a teammate -- who are you as a teammate?

**Pair & Share #2:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. Now describe yourself in regards to your previous job and why you're transitioning careers -- who are you as a career changer?

**Pair & Share #3:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. This time describe yourself as a developer -- who are you as a developer? What kind of developer do you see yourself as?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* Which details stayed consistent across your different stories?
* Which details were different?
* What was relatively easy or difficult about this exercise?

Personal branding is all about telling a consistent story about yourself, building out the details of this story with each profile. As you start this new career, telling your story as a new member of the software industry in as many consistent ways as possible will help you stand out and embrace that identity even more. 

Today, we'll look at a few tools you should use to define and build your personal brand. 

### LinkedIn
If you don't already have a LinkedIn profile, now is time to set one up [here](https://www.linkedin.com/). 

### LinkedIn Learning Competencies
- Specify personal brand
- Identify transferable and new technical skills
- Tell your story effectively

#### Show Effective Examples

#### Content Update

- Edit your Headline to represent what you want to be known for rather than dependent on your most recent working title. Consider "Software Developer" "Web Developer" or you can combine your past experiences with new skills like "Software Developer \| Former Educator"
- Identify your location with the zip code of the location of your number one location choice so that you show up in searches where you're looking for opportunities.
- Edit your vanity URL using your first and last name. Don't use numbers in your vanity URL -- numbers can open you up to potential age discrimination.
- Add your past experiences. Descriptions should demonstrate transferable skills. These descriptions should be in a paragraph, anecdotal form rather than bullet points.
- Place the education section below experience. Include Turing School of Software & Design under Education to help other alums connect with you now and in the future.
- Move skills section to the bottom of the profile. These will help recruiters find you in searches.
- Add a summary that tells your story from a high level answering the following questions: Who are you (as a developer, teammate, individual, etc.), how'd you get here (why software development, why now, etc.), what's next? (what are your  long term ambitions/goals). Include your email in the summary so those who aren't able to directly connect can still contact you. Remember, to wrap up the summary with a call to action.
- Add your connections to build a network of at least 50 connections (but always aim for 500+ quality connections). Don't forget to add Turing staff:

- Engage with your connections by liking, commenting on, and/or sharing their updates.

### Twitter Learning Competencies
- Display your brand visually and through written content
- Engage in conversations that reinforce your personal brand

### Looking Good
- Include a headshot of **_you_**
- Include your personal website link, email, and mini, high-level bio introduction
- Consider what your profile says about you to someon that has never met you

### Converse
- Search for topics interesting to you ("webdev", "edtech", "diversity in tech")
- Consider how you would approach a conversation at a party. Listen, observe, then evaluate when is appropriate to interject with your opinion, perspective, knowledge.
- Add to the conversation

### GitHub Learning Competencies
- Add a headshot photo rather than using the avatar - CTOs will think you're an amateur otherwise
- Complete GitHub profile with:
	- location
	- link to personal site once you have one
	- Twitter handle

### Complete Profile
- Share your email address, personal website, location, headshot
- Never block someone from connecting with you while you are job searching -- the more information the better


### Extension -- how to apply these principles to personal websites and beyond?
