### Opening

#### Hook: Storytelling Follow-Up
Last week, we spent time talking about our stories in terms of our identities, values, and strengths. Today, we'll practice storytelling in other contexts to dive into our developer identity.

**Pair & Share #1:** Find a partner for a 2-minute conversation. You'll describe yourself as a teammate -- who are you as a teammate?

**Pair & Share #2:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. Now describe yourself in regards to your previous job and why you're transitioning careers -- who are you as a career changer?

**Pair & Share #3:** Find a new partner for a 2-minute conversation. This time describe yourself as a developer -- who are you as a developer? What kind of developer do you see yourself as?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* Which details stayed consistent across your different stories?
* Which details were different?
* What was relatively easy or difficult about this exercise?

Personal branding is all about telling a consistent story about yourself, building out the details of this story with each profile. As you start this new career, telling your story as a new member of the software industry in as many consistent ways as possible will help you stand out and embrace that identity even more. 

Today, we'll look at a few tools you should use to define and build your personal brand. 

### LinkedIn
If you don't already have a LinkedIn profile, now is time to set one up [here](https://www.linkedin.com/). 

How to be passive on linkedin (1 session) followed up with Finding Opportunities (mod 3 session)

Learning how to be passive - how do people find you? How do they know you exist? Has to do with how they tell their stories and keywords they're using; 

When looking at LI profile:
-headline should not be tied to your working title; it's what you want to be known for; what do you want your brand to be? What words do you want to be associated with? Use the things that you do to brand yourself
	Example: Sonia, wants to be a speaker, title might be Software Developer, Speaker, Diversity Advocate
	Put in what you want to be found by
-Recruiters see: your picture, your title, your location, and the first few sentences of your summary (why it's so important)
	Location: where do you want to go? That's what should be in the profile; Ex: San Francisco
-Summary: Story that they're telling; who are you, why are you here, what's next -- these are prompts, like the Hook activity; first 100 words better be really solid
	This story is one of the few places where they can introduce themselves as a whole person; should be short paragraphs, 2-3 sentences per paragraph; should be in first person; provide a call to action -- what do you want people to do when they see your profile? Do you want them to look at your code, website, email you? Put your email address right there in the summary; Once you get a job, you can take it out, but don't create any blockers
-Experience: Description should not be bullet points; it doesn't read as well on LI and interferes with keyword searches; it's also built out to be more of a story form, complete sentences and paragraph; not long but value driven rather than task-driven; what was the value that you brought to this company? It doesn't matter as much the tasks, but it's about what employers want to see
	It's better to not have things in a list-form; think about how you read across a computer screen; you want it to be easy to scan; recruiters only have so much time to look at the profiles, make it easy for them
	-Linked to the name of the company; under experience, they should have Turing under experience but clearly state that they're students at Turing (don't want to mislead anyone -- could lead to being dismissed from an interview process); Edit Title to Software Developer Student or Back End Engineering Student/Front End Engineering Student at Turing; then discuss their experience while here -- what technologies/etc did they learn?
	-Then also include it in education -- ties you into Turing alumni page which also allows future students to seek out jobs just like they are; it shows where all alumni work; this is why you should have this under education
-Unique URL: Edit URL with name; just first and last name, no numbers -- don't want to create any age discrimation; if your name is taken, use middle name, etc. but should be consistent across all social platforms; also easy to put on business card, etc.

Nice to haves:
-Projects; any visuals are helpful; not necessary bc recruiters aren't going to see that on first look; will see it on second sweep
-Skills: move these all the way to the bottom; if can reorder, skills should be on the bottom; they should have them in all technologies they use even if not endorsed, but they should be in the lower part
-Don't spend a ton of time on extras
-Merging -- only if someone has never really used social media; if they have more than 1, then use the merge
-Make your LI in multiple languages -- for different communities; Talk to Amara about this
	
	
	Note: show LI alumni group in Finding Opportunities

### LinkedIn Learning Competencies
- Specify personal brand
- Identify transferable and new technical skills
- Tell your story effectively

#### Content Update

- Edit your Headline to represent what you want to be known for rather than dependent on your most recent working title. Consider "Software Developer" "Web Developer" or you can combine your past experiences with new skills like "Software Developer \| Former Educator"
- Identify your location with the zip code of the location of your number one location choice so that you show up in searches where you're looking for opportunities.
- Edit your vanity URL using your first and last name. Don't use numbers in your vanity URL -- numbers can open you up to potential age discrimination.
- Add your past experiences. Descriptions should demonstrate transferable skills. These descriptions should be in a paragraph, anecdotal form rather than bullet points.
- Place the education section below experience. Include Turing School of Software & Design under Education to help other alums connect with you now and in the future.
- Move skills section to the bottom of the profile. These will help recruiters find you in searches.
- Add a summary that tells your story from a high level answering the following questions: Who are you (as a developer, teammate, individual, etc.), how'd you get here (why software development, why now, etc.), what's next? (what are your  long term ambitions/goals). Include your email in the summary so those who aren't able to directly connect can still contact you. Remember, to wrap up the summary with a call to action.
- Add your connections to build a network of at least 50 connections (but always aim for 500+ quality connections). Don't forget to add Turing staff:

- Engage with your connections by liking, commenting on, and/or sharing their updates.

#### Examples of Effective LinkedIn Profiles


### Twitter Overview
- Display your brand visually and through written content
- Engage in conversations that reinforce your personal brand

### Looking Good
- Include a headshot of **_you_**
- Include your personal website link, email, and mini, high-level bio introduction
- Consider what your profile says about you to someone that has never met you

### Converse
- Search for topics interesting to you ("webdev", "edtech", "diversity in tech")
- Consider how you would approach a conversation at a party. Listen, observe, then evaluate when is appropriate to interject with your opinion, perspective, knowledge.
- Add to the conversation

### GitHub Overview
- Add a headshot photo rather than using the avatar - CTOs will think you're an amateur otherwise
- Complete GitHub profile with:
	- location
	- link to personal site once you have one
	- Twitter handle

### Complete Profile
- Share your email address, personal website, location, headshot
- Never block someone from connecting with you while you are job searching -- the more information the better

### What's Next -- how to apply these principles to personal websites and beyond?
