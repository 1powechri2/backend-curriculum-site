# Feedback I
## Confronting Our Feedback Triggers & Writing Effective Feedback

This is the first of 3 different feedback sessions you'll receive at Turing along with a session on mindful communication. We believe that a big component of unlocking your potential at Turing revolves around strengthening your communication skills, and giving and receiving feedback well allows you to improve your practices and strengthen your relationships for longterm growth in your career path.

### Pre-Reading for the Session

[Chapter One from Thanks for the Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Thanks%20For%20the%20Feedback_Ch%201.pdf)

### Slides
[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Objectives

* Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback
* Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback
* Write out and deliver thoughtful feedback for your project partner

### Deliverable

You will submit feedback for each of your project partners this module by sending a paragraph of written feedback intended for your partner in a DM to Allison. She will review your feedback and send you any follow-up notes before the feedback is passed on to your partner. Feedback will also be shared with your instructors. 

Back End: this review will happen *twice* in the module.
Front End: this review will happen *three times* in the module. 

### Session Structure

* Opening (13 mins)
* 

#### Opening
Why are we talking about this? 

The benefits of giving and receiving feedback well include:

* Increased learning and improvements
* Other people find it more enjoyable to work with you
* Easier to collaborate with others to solve problems
* You can set an example to help others see the value in seeking feedback for themselves

**Personal Reflection:**

Think of a couple of pieces of feedback in the recent past that you found tough to receive. Can you recall any physiological reaction that you had to the feedback? What were the most immediate thoughts to go through your mind as you received this feedback? How would you describe your experience in relation to the three triggers (truth, relationship, identity) discussed in the chapter that you read? Which of the three triggers (truth, relationship, or identity) do you find most befuddling and why? What has helped you manage these triggers?

**Turn & Talk:** Share your experience with a partner

Recap the 3 triggers as a whole group:

* Truth
* Relationship
* Identity 

### Three Kinds of Feedback (8 mins)
In order to better recognize our triggers, we need to first understand what kind of feedback we're hearing

* Appreciation:....
* Coaching
* Evaluation

Examples of each;

#### Tips:

* Ask for the type of feedback you want
* At Turing, you should give and receive appreciation and coaching



Here's when feedback can create triggers...

### Intention vs. Impact (15 mins)
Every dialogue includes *intent* and *impact*. The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. 

For example:

| Message | Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
|  |  |  |

* What kind of feedback is this?
* What other impacts might this message have?
* How does this relate to a trigger? 
* How could this language be reframed to be more aligned with the intent? 

Turn & Talk for the next 2 examples:



### Blind Spots (8 mins)




### Being Intentional in Giving Feedback (10 mins)
Clarify your intent by following these 3 guidelines:

* Specific
* Actionable
* Kind

Examples of written feedback:

> Thank you for your contributions, especially in styling of several of our pages in the last few days. The site presentation looks much better as a result. Thank you also for checking in with me before you began working on a new item. I know that you didn’t always feel strong with some of the more complex aspects of our project, and I think that may have caused you to communicate with me less. I feel like there were several times during the project where either you had a missing DB migration or merge conflicts due to working off a branch with a head far behind our current dev_branch. I would suggest that you communicate with your future pairs more often to help avoid these issues. Committing and submitting PR's more often, even if it means smaller steps, would also help resolve merge conflicts along the way rather than letting them build into massive problems that take away from project time. In the last two days of the project, I feel like your contributions improved tremendously, and I very much appreciated the work you did.

What should you be aware of? Written tone
Keep in mind that you’re all trying to help each other -- how can you give feedback that will be the most meaningful?

### You Do: Work Time (10 mins)
Write out your feedback for your project partner






### Three Types of Feedback
* Appreciation (Meaning) -- thanks, I see your hard work
	* Relationship and human connection
	* Motivation
	* Authentic

* Coaching (Accelerate Learning) -- I want to help you improve
	* Learn, grow, change
	* Something is missing or something is wrong

* Evaluation (Know where we stand) -- How you measure up
	* Comparison, implicitly or explicitly, against others or a particular set of standards
	* Aligns expectations and informs decision making
	* Also the LOUDEST
