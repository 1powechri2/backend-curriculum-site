### Strategy 1: Shifting from a Negative State to a Positive One
Participation: Individual

When you feel overwhelmed or stuck with negative emotions, you can utilize this process, which is intended to help you shift your focus from negative emotions to postive ones. Using ideas from [Stress Inoculation Training](http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/learning_modules/psychology/07.TU.09/?section=6) and Barbara Frederickson's research on positive emotions, Sandra L. Foster (PhD, executive coach, and peak performance psychology expert) developed this coaching technique:

1. Identify what is causing you to feel negative emotions such as feeling overwhelmed, confused, unfocused, or stressed.
2. Try to imagine this negative state that you're in becoming more positive -- not *how* to achieve this positive state but just imagining a more positive reality. Closing your eyes might be helpful in this step. 
3. Ask yourself -- how might this negative state be changed so that it will be more positive:
    3 months from now? 
    One month from now? 
    Two weeks from now? 
    One week from now?
    One day from now?
   Do your feelings about the negative situation feel more positive?
4. Brainstorm and write down some positive words or statements strengthen your new positive state. Here are some examples:
    * Breathe
    * Focus
    * I'm OK
    * What is it I am supposed to be doing right now?
    * I can get a grip on my thoughts
    * I've got this
    * Just settle down
    * Smile - it helps
    * I can get on track
    * I can manage this
    * I can break this enormous task down into pieces and tackle each one, step by step
    * What's my task? I can do what I can see/define/clarify
    * We can do it together if we support each other and work together
5. Do your chosen words generate positive feelings for you? If not, find other positive words. The intention is for your positive words to serve a mantra so that they manifest themselves in your body
6. Now, develop a "broaden and build" action plan to accompany your positive words:

    * Make a list to answer the question "What do I need to do?" or "What else might help in this situation?"

**Note:** This process is meant to be used for temporary relief from stress but does not encompass an in-depth reflection. One of the benefits of this technique is that after completing it, your mind should be more clear and open to other stress management tools.
