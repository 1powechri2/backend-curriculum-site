  <h2 id="before">Prework Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their early weeks with us.

  <h3>Your Time at Turing</h3>
  <p>If you haven't heard already, Turing is a fast-paced learning environment. Our goal is to prepare you to be a successful, employable web developer be the end of your 4th module. Being as fast paced as it is, the prework is essential to prepare you for your learning at Turing.</p>
  <p>
    Turing isn't just about learning to code. We want to prepare you technically and in professional skills, which includes supporting Turing's mission and vission:
    <blockquote cite="https://www.turing.io/">
      Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.
    </blockquote>

  <h3>What is Back-End Development?</h3>
  <p>Modern software, and web software especially, is driven by content – without the content, most of it wouldn’t be worth bothering with. And all of that content has to live somewhere. It needs to be stored, retrieved, manipulated, formatted, etc etc. When we talk about “back-end” programming, we’re often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:
    <ul>
      <li>Storing data and accessing it later</li>
      <li>Verifying that data is accurate</li>
      <li>Manipulating and analyzing data</li>
      <li>Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily</li>
    </ul>
  The “front-end” is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The “back-end” typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it’s what happens behind the scenes.

  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
  <p>This prework is spanned across 7 days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - so about 30 hours total. After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish a routine of coding every day</li>
    <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
    <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
    <li>Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development</li>
    <li>Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple game(for show and tell)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, then first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the <a href="#month">month-long prework section</a> that contains additional resources on multple subjects to use as a deeper dive.</p>
  <p>And remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
  <p>Here are the items you will need to complete the prework:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A computer - prefereably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prework Assignments</h2>

  <article id="week">
    <h3 id="daily">Daily Warm Up</h3>
    <p>Practice makes perfect, and these daily tasks will help build on your typing and algorithmic thinking skills. Spend 30 minutes total on these every-day tasks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a></h4>
        <p>Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on Ruby. You would be surprised how many common programming keyboard characters you're not used to typing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><a href="https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/?subtopic=types-and-data-structures" target="_blank">Algorithmic thinking and logic</a></h4>
        <p>Sign up for a free account and work on the free Computer Science Warmups Concepts Challenges at Brilliant.org. Spread these exercises out over the week on each day.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Weeklong Ramp-Up</h3>
    <p>At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is desgined to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.</p>
    <p>Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day prework, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.</p>

      <ul class="expander-content">
        <li>
          <h4>Mac OS Introduction</h4>
          <p>If this is your first time using a Mac instead of a PC or Linux, then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN0FD8KW2V4" target="_blank">this video</a> about using a Mac.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Daily Warm Up</h4>
          <p>Work through <a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a> and <a href="https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/?subtopic=types-and-data-structures" target="_blank">Algorithmic thinking and logic</a> as described in <a href="#daily">Daily Warm Up</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Computer Setup</h4>
          <p>Before you start going through material on Ruby, you'll need to get your system set up. Install these programs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Install the Atom text editor</a></h4>
              <p>Atom is a program where we edit code - it is a text editor with many great features that makes editing code more enjoyable compared to a simple text editor. Atom is commonly used in the software development industry, and we use it throughout your time at Turing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="full-width"><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Install Google Chrome</a></h4>
              <p>Google Chrome is a web browser that is great for general internet perusing, but web developers like it because it has very useful developer tools (the console), which we will touch on in the prework and use extensively during class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Install Xcode</h4>
              <p>Xcode is a huge suite of development tools published by Apple. If we wanted to develop software for the Apple Ecosystem (iPhone apps, macOS apps, etc), we would use Xcode as our editor. But even if we aren’t working in this ecosystem, Xcode provides some system dependencies that we’ll want to have available.</p>
              <p>Download and install Xcode from the Apple App Store - this will probably take a little while to finish. Go get some coffee and eat breakfast...</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Setting up your Environment</h4>
          <p>Now that you have downloaded Atom, you will want to follow the directions listed <a href="../module1/lessons/environment_setup" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Start learning to use the command line in terminal.</h4>
          <p>Watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/152746852">this video</a>.<br><br>Read AND start <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line" target="_blank">these</a> exercises   <br></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Start a Gist to Track Your Prework Progress</h4>
          <p>A gist is basically a file where you can add text, and the file is tied to your GitHub account. Here is some <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/" target="_blank">more information about gists</a>.</p>
          <p>Here is some documentation about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/" target="_blank">how to create a gist</a>.</p>
          <p>From your GitHub account, create a public gist with the filename that includes the word "prework" and your name. Something like: <code>JimSmith_Prework.md</code></p>
          <p>The <code>.md</code> file extension for your gist refers to markdown formatting. Markdown is a simple markup language to help format your text. For example, you can add a heading in markdown using the hash: <code># This is my main heading</code>. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">This article</a> shows everything you need for basic markdown formatting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Answer these questions about your environment setup and command line:</h4>
          <p>Open the prework gist you created earlier, and answer these questions about the reading in your gist:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Did you run into any issues?</li>
            <li>How do you open Atom from your Terminal?</li>
            <li>What is the file extension for a Ruby file?</li>
            <li>What is the Atom shortcut for hiding/ showing your file tree view?</li>
            <li>What is the Atom shortcut for quickly finding a file (fuzzy finder)?</li>
            <li>What does pwd stand for, and how is this command helpful?</li>
            <li>What does ls do? What about cd and mkdir?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/pre-work/intro_with_empathy.markdown" target="_blank">Gear Up</a></h4>
          <p>Turing is not just a school where you learn to code. In order to acheive our mission and vision, we have group sessions each week called Gear Up to bring community awareness about certain issues in the tech industry.</p>
          <p>Read the materials included in the Gear Up link, and answer the questions for the reading in your prework gist.</p>

          <p>
            You've notice that we've been building on the same CodePen throughout the prework so far. On day 7, you will spend the day building a completely new site in Atom (not CodePen).
            You'll take what you've learned throughout days 1-6 and apply it to a completely new webpage. On the first (or second?) day of class, you'll share what you've made on day 7 with the class.
            Just something to keep in mind over these next few days.

          <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWwBQQOGllo&list=PLYzJdSdNWNqwNWlxz7bvu-lOYR0CFWQ4I" target="_blank">Here is a series of videos</a> to get you started learning about Atom. You'll be using Atom throughout your time at Turing, so it's a good idea to invest some time learning about it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Make A New Webpage (Using Atom)</h4>
          <p>Instead of using CodePen to create this webpage, let's use Atom - our text editor. Create a folder (directory) on your computer to hold your site's files.</p>
          <p>Within your folder, create two files:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>index.html</code> to hold your HTML code</li>
            <li><code>style.css</code> to hold your CSS code</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Your site should contain (but is not limited to):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the site about a subject you are passionate about! (something not about coding)</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
            <li>Text (include two different fonts)</li>
            <li>Links</li>
            <li>Images</li>
            <li>A list (ordered or unordered)</li>
            <li>A form</li>
            <li>Usage of color</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To see the HTML code that you've written in the browser, find the <code>index.html</code> file in Finder, and open it using Chrome. Don't forget to link your stylesheet in your <code>index.html</code> file!</p>
          <p>If you're having trouble using Atom to create a webpage, then go ahead and use CodePen for your new site, but we would prefer that you use Atom.</p>
