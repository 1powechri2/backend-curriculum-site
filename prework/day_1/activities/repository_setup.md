Let's create a folder structure to store all of your code. We can start by moving to our home folder, and then creating a Turing folder.

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir turing
```

At this point, we want to enter the directory we have created, and then we will create ourselves a directory for the first module. We call this new directory 1module, so we can use tab complete more easily.

```
cd turing
mkdir prework
mkdir 1module
```

Now that this is complete, you can now get to your first module folder from anywhere through the terminal by typing:

```
cd ~/turing/1module
```

Once we get exposed to more projects, homework, etc, our ultimate 1module folder setup will look like this:

```
prework/
1module/
    - homework/
    - classroom_exercises/
    - morning_exercises/
    - projects/
        - project_name_1/
        - project_name_2/
        - project_name_3/
        - etc.
```

For right now, it's fine to leave your `1module` and `prework` folders empty.
