## Welcome!

Welcome to Turing! In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class.

## Overview

ADD SOMETHING HERE ONCE IN FINAL FORM.


## Required Work

We believe that the work outlined below can be completed in a week, though this certainly does not mean that you should wait to begin.

We have broken this work up into a weekly schedule in order to a) keep you on track if you do intend to complete this work in a week, and b) give you an opportunity to absorb the material through repetition and exercises/questions of increasing difficulty.

The recommended activities for each day are outlined in the pages linked below.

* [Day 0](./day_0/index): Computer set-up.
* [Day 1](./day_1/index): Loops, variables, and numbers.
* [Day 2](./day_2/index): Strings, and string interpolation.
* [Day 3](./day_3/index): Conditional statements and flow-control.
* [Day 4](./day_4/index): Methods.
* [Day 5](./day_5/index): Classes.
* [Day 6](./day_6/index): Arrays, and hashes.
* [Day 7](./day_7/index): Independent projects.
