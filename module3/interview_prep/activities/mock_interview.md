# Getting to Know You

* Tell me a little bit about your background. Walk me through your resume.
* What were you doing before this? Has that impacted you as a programmer? Are there skills that you bring from that experience that will be valuable to us?
* What did your day-to-day look like in previous positions?
* What's Turing like? Can you tell me a little bit about the program?
* What are you looking for in a position?
* How'd you get into programming?
* Why programming?

# Working with You

* Have you worked on a small team before? What was that experience like?
* Have you paired before? Talk to me about that expereince. Do you have a preferred way to pair (driver/navigator, two keyboards/mice, other)? Why?
* What are you usually like in a pair? What would your pairs tell me about you?

# Previous Work

* Do you have experience with SQL? ActiveRecord? Can you tell me about a complicated query you've worked on?
* Can you tell me about some projects you've worked on? Show me examples? Is there any code you're particularly proud of? Can you walk me through it?

# Web Knowledge

* What happens when I enter an address into my browser?
* What can you tell me about the HTTP request response cycle?
* What can you tell me about MVCs? Do you know anything about other web design patterns?
* What's do you like about working in Ruby? Rails? How do you feel it compares to other frameworks?

# Data Modeling (each person in the pair takes one)

* Can you outline for me what classes/methods an object oriented vending machine might have?
* Can you outline for me what classes/methods an object oriented parking garage might have?

For both:
* Walk me through your thinking as you describe it.

# Implement

* For the parking garage - write the classes and methods necessary to:
    * park a car,
    * remove a car from the garage,
    * tell me the current revenue of the garage,
    * tell me how full the garage is.
* For the vending machine - write the classes and methods necessary to:
    * stock the vending machine,
    * buy something from the vending machine,
    * tell me what items need to be refilled,
    * tell me the current revenue of the vending machine.
