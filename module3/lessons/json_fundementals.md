## Lecture

### Warmup

What some cases where you might not want to render an entire page and only send the data to a client?

**Basic Narrative**: When designing a service or an API, you need a machine-readable way to transmit data. Typically, machine-readable formats have been just that—machine-readable. JSON strikes a balance between being machine-readable, but also human-readable. Because it's also more lightweight (read: less characters) it's typically faster because it requires less bandwidth to transmit,

### What is JSON?

* JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"
* It's a subset of the object syntax in JavaScript. All JSON is valid JavaScript, but not all JavaScript objects are valid JSON (functions, non-string keys, etc.)
* It maps easily onto the data structures used by most programming languages (numbers, strings, booleans, nulls, arrays and hashes/dictionaries)
* It looks and acts similarly like Ruby's hash syntax
* It's lightweight and easy for humans to read and write
* Most programming languages have a library for reading and writing JSON structures

**tl;dr**: JSON strikes a balance between being human readable and machine readable.

JSON is commonly used by APIs to send data back and forth when you don't need/want to render a full web page.

### Writing JSON

JSON data structures are typically either a object (similar to a hash for the purposes of this discussion) or an array of objects or other values.

JSON objects follow some rules:

* Objects are made up of name/value pairs
* Keys must be double-quoted and followed by a colon

You also have a few types of values available in a JSON structure:

* Numbers
* Strings (in double quotes only)
* Booleans (`true` and `false`)
* Arrays
* Objects (again, objects in JavaScript are similar to hashes in Ruby)
* `null`

#### Example

`var person = '{"name":"Jennifer Johnson","street":"641 Pine St.","phone":true,"age":50,"pets":["cat","dog","fish"]}'`

#### Some Common Mistakes

* Using single quotes instead of double quotes
* Not using quotes at all (e.g. JavaScript doesn't require quotes on keys nor does Ruby's symbol shorthand)
* Including a trailing comma in an array
* Trying to break a string over multiple lines (`\n` is fine)

### Where you'll find JSON

* APIs (e.g. Github, Twitter)
* Node's `package.json` and Bower's `bower.json` dependency manifests
* Sending data back and forth to your app through AJAX requests; building DOM with on the client with data from the server

### JSON versus XML

Let's look at some data in JSON and XML.

### JSON and JavaScript

Most JavaScript runtimes come with a JSON library built-in. Occasionally you'll see [Douglas Crockford's `json2.js`](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) library included in a website. This is usually for backwards compatibility in older browsers (ahem, Internet Explorer).

Even if all JavaScript objects are not JSON objects, all JSON objects are JavaScript objects.

So, it's tempting to thinks that when you pull some JSON in on the client side, that you're good to go.

_Not so fast._

What you're actually getting a string of JSON that can be turned back into a JavaScript object. The JSON library gives you two handy methods for working with JSON in JavaScript.

* `JSON.parse` This method accepts a string of JSON and turns it into a JavaScript object.
* `JSON.stringify` This method accepts a JavaScript object and turns it into a JSON string.

These methods are relatively straight-forward. `parse` will take a string of JSON and turn it into a JavaScript object. `stringify` will take a JavaScript object and—umm—_stringify_ it.

`JSON.parse` is fairly strict. If there is an error in your JSON, it will throw an error—and usually not a particularly helpful one. If you're getting some cryptic errors, toss your JSON into [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) and make sure your JSON is malformed in some way before you spend too much time scratching your head trying to figure out what's wrong.

Let's try parsing and stringifying data in the console.

### JSON with jQuery

Along with building APIs, a common case for JSON is to dynamically load content into your page using AJAX. The "X" in AJAX stands for XML, but it's common to use JSON these days.

In fact, requesting JSON from the server is so common that jQuery provides your with a helpful function:

```js
$.getJSON('/tweets.json', function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

`$.getJSON` sets up the AJAX request for you and also automatically parses the response back into a JavaScript object so you don't have to. The bad news is that there isn't a `$.postJSON` function—so, you're on your own for that one.

### JSON and Ruby

The `json` library is part of the standard library these days, so there is no need to require it in your `Gemfile`.

Requiring the `json` library gives you `JSON.parse` and  `JSON.generate`. It also adds a `.to_json` method to most objects.

```rb
require 'json'

my_hash = { :hello => "goodbye" }
puts JSON.generate(my_hash) #=> "{\"hello\":\"goodbye\"}"
puts  {:hello => "goodbye" }.to_json #=> "{\"hello\":\"goodbye\"}"
```

```rb
require 'json'
person = "{\"name\":\"Jennifer Johnson\",\"street\":\"641 Pine St.\",\"phone\":true,\"age\":50,\"pets\":[\"cat\",\"dog\",\"fish\"]}"
puts JSON.parse(person) #=> {"name"=>"Jennifer Johnson", "street"=>"641 Pine St.", "phone"=>true, "age"=>50, "pets"=>["cat", "dog", "fish"]}
```

If you're feeling adventurous, there are some alternative libraries out there that make various promises:

* [Oj](http://www.ohler.com/oj/)
* [Yaji](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby)

[MultiJSON](https://github.com/intridea/multi_json) will simply choose the fastest available JSON parser available (defaulting to the built-in one if you don't have any installed).
