## Code Along - AJAX

### Repository

Birdeck is a twitter like service were you'll find posts. The homepage, [found here](https://turing-birdie.herokuapp.com), explains what routes you have available. We will use the Birdeck repository. You can find the code below. Make sure you clone the repository Birdeck - `git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/birdeck.git`. It is a simple html page which we will use to display and interact with the the Birdeck API.

*   Birdeck - [Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/birdeck.git)
*   Birdie (third-party API)
    *   [Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/birdie)
    *   [Heroku](https://turing-birdie.herokuapp.com)

## Workshops

### Workshop 1: Refresh

1.  Right now, you have to reload the page to get the new posts. Can you modify your app so that the posts are reloaded when you click a button?
2.  Right now, there is some duplication when we render the template, can you refactor?

### Workshop 2: Polling & PUT

1.  Right now, you have to click on a button to refresh the feed. Can you check the server every 5 seconds to see if there are any new posts?
2.  Can you implement a PUT option to modify the data via AJAX?
