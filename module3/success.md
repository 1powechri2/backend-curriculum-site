## Completion Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 3, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the [final assessment rubric](lessons/assessment).

### Independent Work

*Expected*: During M3 students will be required to complete API Curious as an independent project. Full requirements for that project can be found [here](projects/apicurious).

*Expected*: Students will be required to complete a personal project during weeks 5 and 6 of this module. It will be up to them to determine if they wish to complete that project independently. It is also included below under "Group Work", and students should include it in their portfolio submission in the appropriate section.

*Optional*: Students are encouraged to include the results of their in-class work and tutorials.

### Group Work

*Expected*: Students, as a pair, document the results of their [Rales Engine](projects/rails_engine) project.

*Expected*: Students, as a group, document the results of their [Cloney Island](projects/cloney_island) project.

*Expected*: Students will be required to complete a personal project during weeks 5 and 6 of this module. It will be up to them to determine if they wish to complete that project independently. It is also included above under "Independent Work", and students should include it in their portfolio submission in the appropriate section.

### Professional Skills

The professional skills curriculum is available [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/module_three). Students will be required to submit their deliverables as a pull request to the [Career Development Curriculum Repository](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions)

Meg Stewart will review these deilverables, provide feedback, and alert the M3 instructional team of any deficiencies prior to portfolio reviews. Please provide a brief description of the career development work that you completed in your portfolios.

### Feedback & Community

As stewards of the larger Turing community, Module 4 students are expected to **complete at least one** of the following:

* lead or co-lead a Friday Spike session
* provide substantial contributions to a posse project that is deployed during the course of this module
* pair three or more times with students in lower modules
* contribute in a meaningful way to the project of a student/team *not* in your module

* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique
