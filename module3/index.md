### Module 3 Scope and Sequence

### Purpose

In Module 3, we will look beyond the basics of building Rails web applications with the intent of taking a business need and turning it into working software. Students will be comfortable using agile processes to integrate third party APIs, produce APIs, build Rails applications that consume and process data beyond basic CRUD functionality, and improve the performance of their app through AJAX, caching, and background workers.

### Success

Success in B3 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the following concepts:
