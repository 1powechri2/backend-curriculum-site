Strengths reflection piece...

### Your Turn



## Resumes
### Resume Learning Competencies

- Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and experience
- Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role
- Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards

### Research
Take a look at a few examples before getting started:

 - [Example 1](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/josh_cass.pdf)
 - [Example 2](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/rose_a_kohn.pdf)

### Layouts
You can choose to set up a traditional resume use a template like this [traditional resume](http://visualcv.com/www/google-docs-resume-templates/), but you may want to personalize the style with a layout. Check out these sites for building a resume:

* [Creddle](http://creddle.io/)
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
* [I Need a Resume](http://ineedaresu.me/#/)
* [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/)

### Content Inclusion
- Add a __Header:__ Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)
- Add an __About Me__ section with the 1 - 3 sentence intro you created in [What's Your Story](/Your_Story.md)
- Add a __Skills__ section: Highlight your dev/technical skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well.
- Add a __Projects__ section. What are you proud of? Show it off!
	* Be sure to include the following four elements for each project on your resume:
		*	__What does your application do?__ What problem does it solve for the end user? Who is it built for?
		*	__In what period of time was it built?__ This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
		*	__What was your role in the project?__ Front end? Testing? Team lead?
		*	__Technologies used__ This might be the most brag-worthy part for you, but since this element is likely the longest of the four, leave it for the end. Go nuts - dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.

	* Does each project on your resume link to a GitHub repo? Does the ReadMe for each project include screenshots of the application in action?

	* Think back to your countless experiences in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Would you even _consider_ trying out an application without screenshots to tell you what it looks like? Nope.
- Add an __Experience__ section.

	*	Lead with your position title, then the company name
	*	Use dates
	*	Each bullet should be value-driven rather than task-oriented.
	*	Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, _What were your boring day-to-day duties?_
- Add an __Education__ section to the bottom of the resume. Remove GPAs and list in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent.

As you update your resume, check on what updates you need to make to your LinkedIn -- update this profile as often as necessary to ensure it reflects exactly what you want it to portray.

### Closing
Find another person in the room to introduce yourself in a few sentences using the new story you've been developing. 


How do you know when you have crossed the line and entered the realm where you can call yourself a developer? Stop what you are doing right now and Google your name, if the results do not show that you are a developer, then this talk is for you. This talk will empower new developers to make themselves known in the community and not wait to start. This talk will also cover ways to build on your experience as well as develop your story to set yourself apart from the other developers looking for a job.
