### Overview of Session



### Opening
Looking for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. Today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on your resume or job postings.

Focus on finding companies and people you'd like to work with or for, and don't get sidetracked with whether or not they have job listings posted that match your skillset. The goal is to think longterm. Some of these opportunities may turn into future opportunities, rather than your first job. Be open-minded because you never know what will come of these conversations you'll start having.

Tools:
* Meetups
* LinkedIn
* Google

Tracking:
* You'll use Trello for tracking your leads. Make sure to add Meg as a collaborator
