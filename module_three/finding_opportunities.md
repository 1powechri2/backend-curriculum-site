# Finding Opportunities

[Slides for this session](

### Objectives

* Redefine how best to find job opportunities without limiting job search to job boards or job listings
* Discuss more effectie job-searching strategies to include: Meetup, LinkedIn, cold outreach, boolean searches to produce more potential opportunities
* Research companies and people to create a list of opportunities

### Deliverable
You'll include a link to your Trello board with companies that you're tracking in your [PD deliverable submissions](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions). This submission is due Monday of Week 6 at 9am. Please reach out to Meg if you have any questions!

### Why
Now is the point in your Turing education to start on your job search, and through this session, we'll discuss tools of how to approach the job search in an intentional way that will also make the search less overwhelming.  

### Overview of Session
* Opening/Hook (7 mins)
* Set up Trello (
* Explore tools (


### Opening 
**Hook:** Think about your last job search. What strategies did you use? Which proved to be successful? Which were not successful? Turn and talk to the person next to you to share your experience. What trends came up?

Looking for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. Today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on your resume or job postings.

Focus on finding companies and people you'd like to work with or for, and don't get sidetracked with whether or not they have job listings posted that match your skillset. The goal is to think longterm. Some of these opportunities may turn into future opportunities, rather than your first job. Be open-minded because you never know what will come of these conversations you'll start having.

Tools:

* Meetups
* LinkedIn
* Google

Tracking:

* You'll use Trello for tracking your leads. Make sure to add Meg as a collaborator

### Set Up Trello
Trello is a wonderful project management tool


### Meetup Differently
Meetup is traditionally used to find local networking groups. However, it can also be used to find companies you would like to work with.

#### Your Turn
* Navigate to Meetup.com
* Using information from your Flower Exercise findings, search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working and in topics that you're interested in purusing (i.e. Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Be sure to select "Groups" (not "Calendar").
* On the group page, there are two things that will be very useful to your job search: 
    * Organizers list
    * Upcoming events
* Check out who the organizers are. Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in? Are any of these companies of interest?
* Now navigate to the RSVP list. Who else is going? What companies do they work for? These are great resources for finding companies that you may be interested in working for that you may not have known before!

### LinkedIn Actively
It's not enough to just have a profile and hope employers find you. Use LinkedIn to learn more about people using similar skills to those you'd like to use in your career or find people with the working titles you'd like to have, living in the location you'd like to be living and working in, and working in the industry you'd like to be working in.

#### Your Turn

* Navigate to LinkedIn.com
* Use the "Advanced Search" tool to find people based on skillset, location, and industry.
* In "Keywords" type in the skills or focus you want to be working in (i.e., JavaScript, Ruby, Python, EdTech, FinTech, etc.)
* In "Location" type in the area you'd like to be working it, whether it is where you're located or not.
* In "Industry" select "computer software"
* Select search
* Of those profiles that return, look at their profiles to see the list of companies they've worked for throughout their experience.
* Add those companies of interest to your company tracker, include the person(s) you believe you could build a relationship with at those companies.
