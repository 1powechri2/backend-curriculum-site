# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
* Be hired at a company in Denver 
* Be comfortable with JavaScript syntax, have explored Node & Express. 

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
* Send outreach emails each day
* Start to tap my mentors for companies that may be able to hook it up
* Have at least one coffee date per week from now until graduation 
* Stay organized with my calendar 
* Make an excel Spreadsheet of companies I want to hit up and find contacts for each 
* Pay attention in Module four! 

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*I need to become profficient with JavaScript so I can get my hands dirty with Node*

#### Opportunities Research:
*I'll look for companies using BuiltInColordao, my mentors, and Turing staff (Meg) to find companies that hold my interest. My little excel spreadsheet will be invaluable for keeping me organized.* 

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*I'll hit the alumni network hard. This is the most fruitful combination of prospective jobs and people who are already in my network. 

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*Navigating the job hunt as one of the youngest students at Turing.*
