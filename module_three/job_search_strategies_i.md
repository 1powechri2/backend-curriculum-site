# Opening
Job searching brings up a lot of questions:

* What do you want to do after you complete Turing? 
* What do you want to do on a daily basis? 
* What do you want from your career in the longterm? 
* How do you see yourself contributing to technology? 
* Will you work on a product that impacts your learning exponentially? 
* Are you open to traveling for consulting or do you prefer to stay put in a single location?

Trying to answer all of these questions can feel overwhelming, but in this session, we'll discuss strategies for distilling your thoughts into a plan for approaching and completing your job search successfully.  

## Step One: Define Who You Are & Where You Want to Go
The Flower Exercise forced you to take a deeper dive into what skills, knowledge, and values have informed your professional journey thus far, and we'll build on those reflections to analyze how our career could provide us with the opportunities we seek. 

How can you do that? Start by looking at your completed Flower Exercise. What bullet points stick out to you as most important in describing who you are? How can you take the most important bullets and combine them into a career you love?

**I Do:** Allison will model how she might create a professional summary about herself using her Flower Exercise:

* I value helping others reach their fullest potential, and my skills in coaching, active listening, and providing feedback ensure that I can be successful in a career that does just that. I hope to combine my passion and knowledge around curriculum-planning to coach others on a wider spectrum, and I also hope to do this work in a way that provides the right work-life balance to allow me to pursue my passion for writing as well. 

### Your Turn
**Write:** Spend five minutes analyzing your Flower Exercise and writing out a draft of who you are and what you're looking for. 

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else to share your draft. Your partner will repeat back to you what they heard you say in order to convey how clear this draft is. Make sure to ask each other questions if there is something you're unsure of in the summary. You'll then be able to go back and revise this draft of what you're looking for. 

**Extension:** Having trouble with your resume and/or LinkedIn summaries? Workshop this summarized definition of who you are to revise your summaries for those tools. How might you incorporate your strengths into this summary as well?

## Step Two: Decide on Priorities
Now that you have an idea of where you want to go, it's time to decide on what priorities will help you get there. Similar to your priorities when apartment-hunting, job searching is easier to navigate when utilizing a list of must-have's and nice-to-have's. It's important to know what is a deal breaker and when you are being too picky. In the case that you do not find a position with all the items on your list, what are you willing to forego for a great first job as a developer?

Priorities could include: physical location, industry, size of company, team culture, diversity makeup, technologies, flexibility, salary amount, types of benefits, mentorship, etc. 

### Your Turn
Using your Flower Exercise, sketch out a list of things you'll be looking for in a job as a software developer. Then create two columns, labelled "Must-Have" and "Nice-To-Have":

- If you could only have five of those things, which five would it be?
- Move the rest to the "Nice-to-Have" list
- If you could only have one of the things in your list of five, which would it be?
- Prioritize based on how you narrowed it down and identify why they are prioritized in this order

**Pair & Share:** Share your lists with the same partner you discussed your story with. Do your partner's "must-haves" align with their goals and career trajectory? 

## Step Three: Create a PLan & Schedule
Job searching takes time, and you'll need to structure your search as part of your daily responsibilities. Both for module four and post-graduation, you'll need to build out a schedule that includes time for research, cold and warm outreach, networking, and coding. This schedule will look differently when you're in Turing versus after you complete Turing. For now, we'll focus on a plan for Module 4. 

**Tips for sticking to your schedule:** 

### Your Turn
Create a draft of a plan
- During Turing:
	- Look at the time you have to dedicate to job searching during your time at Turing
	- Identify how many hours per week you can spend on job searching, even if it is only two hours per week
	- Block that time off on your calendar
	- Set goals for tasks to complete during that time based on weekly goals

## Goal Setting
Setting goals will help guide your final set of scheduling and priorities. Set your end of Module 4 goal first. For example, that could be: *"receive job offer by the end of Module 4 Week 6."* From there, work backwards to identify your module, weekly, and daily goals. Be mindful that there may need to be some adjustments to goals as you get into the job search. *That is okay and completely normal.* This plan is something that you'll provide to Meg, but she will work with you on any adjustments that need to be made. 

Creating goals 

### Your Turn
- When is your absolutely cut off for completing your job search?
- When would you realisitcally like to have your job search completed by?
- Based on that date, identify what needs to happen on a monthly basis to reach that date? i.e. If I want a job within six weeks after completing Turing, I would need to have at least three interviews within the first month after Turing.
- Based on the monthly goals, what would need to happen on a weekly basis to reach the monthly goals? i.e. If I want at least three interviews within the first month, I would need to have at least 12 new conversations per week.
- Based on the weekly goals, what would need to happen on a daily basis to reach the weekly goals? i.e. If I want at least 12 new conversations per week, I would need to send at least five cold/warm outreach emails per day.
- Spend thirty minutes each day and an hour each week assessing how your tasks aligned with your goals. Make adjustments as needed -- it's so important to be flexible, kind to yourself, and realistic with time.



### Goal Setting
Set your long term goal first and work backwards identifying monthly, weekly and daily goals.                                                         "Accept job offer within 8 weeks of graduating from Turing." 
		1. Monthly?
			* Need at least three interviews within the first month 
		2. Weekly?
			* During Turing-need at least 2 conversations per week
			* After-Need at least 12 new conversations per week are needed
		3. Daily?
			* During-Need at least 1 cold outreach email/day
			* After-Need at least 5 cold/warm outreach emails are needed/day. 

#### Reminders
* Be flexible, kind to yourself, and realistic with your time. 
* If something isnâ€™t working, try something different
* Schedule a 1-on-1 with Meg to discuss this plan and any adjustments at [https://megstew.youcanbook.me}(https://megstew.youcanbook.me) password: complete
