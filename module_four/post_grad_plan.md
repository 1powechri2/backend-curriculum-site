# Post-Grad Job Search Action Plan Template

*This deliverable needs to be submitted to Meg in order to have post-grad job search support from her.*

The objectives of this plan are to not only help you strategize for your job search after graduation but also to help you plan for your longterm career. After all, your first developer job should align with those goals as well so that you're on track for a longterm successful career. 

Some things to consider:

* What do you envision for your career?
* What do you want your 2nd and 3rd jobs to look like?
* How do you want to be involved with the Turing community? The greater developer community?
* Where do your passions lie?

Fill out the first and second parts of this plan. The third part is optional although highly encouraged. 

**Note:** If you have already secured a job prior to graduation, skip the first part of this plan and please fill out the second part of this plan. 

## Schedule & Goals for the Job Search
1. Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for: 
	* Code
	* Outreach
	* Research 
	* Network   
	* Any other areas where you'd like to grow
How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?


2. Backwards planning: when do you want to receive and sign an offer by?


3. What are your monthly and weekly goals to achieve that? Keep in mind goals for coding, researching, networking, cold outreach, and interviews

* What skills would you like to improve or develop?



Here is an [example](https://gist.github.com/kjs222/7ef5e79a71eedf9d8c8d401da1e687c7) of clearly outlined goals and schedule to complete them. 

## Longterm Goal-setting
Where do you want to go in your career? 

Reflect a [narrative rule described by Emma Coats, former Pixar story artist](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar):

	Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. 
	Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
	
1. Imagine that it's 5 years from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? What steps did you take to achieve your goals?

2. Create a vision statement for these longterm goals.

	Guidelines for writing your vision statement:

	* Make your statements stretching, challenging, and interrupting of the status quo.
	* Write in the future tense (I will...)
	* Is the statement grounded -- have you been able to demonstrate something similar in the past?


3. Reference what you outlined in your Flower Exercise -- what preferred level of responsibility do you want to move to? Do you want to start your own company? What kind of work do you see yourself doing longterm? In your first year on the job, what skills do you want to develop to work towards your longterm goals?





## Optional: Furthering your Skills and Contributing to the Developer Community
You're encouraged to pick one of the below options to work on in addition to the previous two. However, these are both completely optional.

### Side Hustle Plan
What side project(s) do you want to work on? How could you 

* Read about 

Optional: 
-3. Options (encouraged to pick at least 1): 
	-Side hustle: what side projects do you want to work on?
		-Deliverable: read about side projects; brainstorm your own ideas and then document a plan for your side project
	-Open Source: Similar to what they now do during the module; go find an OS project and list a couple projects you’d be interested in, why you’re interested, how you’ll contribute (it’s just a plan to contribute)
	-Community Involvement: list 3 conferences and info about them, list 3 meetups and their details, come up blog post ideas (planning to contribute to the community)

Career Plan
-Envisioning the future using strengths
-For both already have jobs and are looking for jobs
