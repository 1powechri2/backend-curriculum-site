### Deliverable

Provide a synopsis of 6 cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md) via the [PD submissions repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions) by **Monday of Week 5**

A suggested way to break down completing this deliverable:

* Week 1: Complete 1 email today! Conduct more research for who you will contact
* Week 2: Complete 1 email
* Week 3: Complete 2 emails 
* Week 4: Complete 2 emails
* Week 5: Submit your summary of interactions using the guidelines above to the submissions folder

### Opening
In the last cold outreach session in Module Two, our focus was mostly on "warm outreach" as you used the mentorship network at Turing to start building relationships. But now we'll take the same principles from that session and apply them to creating relationships with people outside of the Turing community. 

What are those principles? Here's a quick recap:

### Why Cold Outreach


Informational Interviews -- PURPOSE and how to approach them correctly

### How to Leverage Your Network

### Group Feedback
Spend ten minutes  Draft emails and discuss with groups. Instructor models first with an ok example and an exemplar example.

Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations -- include helpful constructive comment examples from Lia/Meg's slides

### Closing & Next Steps
Remember to document your cold outreach in your Trello board -- this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you've kept a record of what has happened.
