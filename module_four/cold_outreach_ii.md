* Week 5: Submit your summary of interactions using the guidelines above to the submissions folder

### Opening
In the last cold outreach session in Module Two, our focus was mostly on "warm outreach" as you used the mentorship network at Turing to start building relationships. But now we'll take the same principles from that session and apply them to creating relationships with people outside of the Turing community. 

What are the best practices?

### Why Cold Outreach
When it comes to your job search, meeting people to have discussions about companies and experiences is much more effective than sending your resume out into the abyss. Creating opportunities to meet those people is where cold outreach comes in. The technology industry is a relatively small community, and networking is key to becoming a part of that community. 

When you're reaching out to people, what is your purpose? Discuss potential ideas. (Hint: It's not to ask for a job)

Suggested purposes:

* Informational Interview 
* Tour office
* Hiring junior developers

Most common purpose: Informational Interviews -- what is the purpose of an informational interview? How can you approach this? 

* Specific time and place
* Ask about experience, projects, where they’d work next, what they’d change about their current role/team, advice for getting started in the industry
* Bring pen + paper, leave computer closed

### How to Leverage Your Network
How can you leverage the network you already have? 

* Mentors: who does your mentor know who would be helpful to you? 
* Use your Trello Board
* LinkedIn: who works at companies that you're interested in?
* [Built in Colorado](http://www.builtincolorado.com/companies): find more companies

### Do Some Research
What do you know about the person you're contacting? 

Find out where their interests lie. Read their Medium blog posts, sign up for their newsletters, and check out their websites. Check out these resources:

* Product Hunt 
* AngelList
* Venture Beat 
* CrunchBase

You need to know their goals as much as you want them to know yours.

### Finding Contact Info
Tools:

* [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
* [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
* GitHub
* Personal website

### Crafting your Email
Develop a template to use. This will help you stay on script and get to the point.

1. Use the subject line: 

Create a subject line that instantly makes the recipient understand that the message is for them. The point is to isolate a unique reason that explains why this matters to them and entices them to read more. Make it:

    * Short and real - lose the sales pitch
    * Relevant and personal
    * Consider how the snippet extends the subject line
    
    "Life at [amazing company]" 
    OR
    "
2. Greeting (simple, not overly formal): 
    Hello [Name],
3. Body: 
    *Who am I? How did I find you? What do I want?*
    I'm a software developer in Denver. I found your contact info after researching ....


### What NOT to do
* 


### Follow Up
1. What if they don't respond?
2. what to do when they do respond

### Examples
Example Emails


### Group Feedback
Spend ten minutes  Draft emails and discuss with groups. Instructor models first with an ok example and an exemplar example.

Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations -- include helpful constructive comment examples from Lia/Meg's slides

### Closing & Next Steps
Remember to document your cold outreach in your Trello board -- this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you've kept a record of what has happened.
