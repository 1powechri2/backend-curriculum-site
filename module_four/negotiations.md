# Negotiations
## How to Ask for What You Want

For some reason we live in a world that is afraid to talk openly about money. That changes for you today. In this session, we'll have an open discussion about averages our alums are currently making in full-time junior developer jobs, apprenticeships, internships, and contract/freelance opportunities -- and how you should negotiate for what you want.

### Session Structure

* Opening (8 mins)
* Discussion Points

- Evaluate offer package for more than solely the salary amount
- Navigate negotiation in polite, professional manner with humility
- Navigate multiple offers
- Navigate offer while still in interview process with other companies

### Opening
Reflect in journals:

* When you hear the words "bargaining" and "haggling," what words or images come to mind? 
* When you hear the word "negotiating," what words or images come to mind?
* How are these images/word associations different or similar? 

**Whole Group Discussion:**

* How would you answer the question, *"what are your salary expectations?"* 

When you are asked that question, recognize that you don't have the context to provide an answer -- and you don't have to. Let's discuss why not. 

### Discussion Points

* **Why Negotiating Matters:**

  * A negotiation conversation could take as little as 5 minutes. Think about that. You generally can’t do 5 minutes of work this year and have your boss give you an extra $5,000. But you can pick up $5,000 in salary negotiations just by having a conversation about your compensation. That makes your negotiation five very important minutes so that no money is left on the table. You can't afford to *not* negotiate. 

  * Keep in mind that the [wage gap](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-0323-pay-gap-20160323-story.html) in [tech](http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/gender-pay-gap/women-in-tech) is very real. Creating transparency around salaries is an important step in closing that gap, and that transparency starts with negotiations. Do not let money stay on the table that could be yours. 

* **Shift your Mindset to Embrace Negotiations:**
  * **Turn & Talk:** What did you write down at the beginning of the session about your associations with the idea of negotiating? It's time to unpack our feelings about negotiating in order to be empowered to have this conversation in a meaningful way. What are your initial feelings about the idea of negotiating? 
  * Bottom line: Successful people negotiate

* **Back to the initial question -- "What are your salary expectations?"**

  * If asked, *"What are your salary expectations"*, do not put a number on the table -- you can't offer and negotiate for yourself. Instead, say: *"I would love to hear what you're offering for this position so I can have more context for the conversation."*
  * During this discussion, you may be talking with a hiring manager. Don’t be offended if they ask you again -- they are just doing what they've been told, and they might not be equipped to go through a negotiation at that time. You should still push back about wanting to know more about what is being offered. 

* **Having the Conversation:**
  * Always negotiate in person or via phone, **never through email.**
  * Eliminate passive language when negotiating, but always be generous and respectful.
  * Never ask for more than 10% more than what they offered you, unless rare circumstance that we've discussed prior to negotiating.
  * It may be helpful to say, *"I was hoping to make **X** how can we close the gap on this?"
  
* **Create Leverage:**  
  * If you are in other interviews, let those companies know you've received an offer letter, but that you're most interested in an opportunity with their company. Then ask if they could let you know a timeline for making a hiring decision so you can let the other company know when you could make your decision by. (Always do this verbally -- never through email.)
  * When you find out timelines from the other companies you're interviewing with, let the offering company know that you're very thankful and excited for the opportunity, however you're deep in the process with "x number" of companies and it's too early into your career to burn any bridges, you'd like to honor the process. Could you give them an answer by "X" date? (Always do this in person or via phone so the hiring manager can hear you're sincere).

* **After Receiving an Offer:**
  * When you receive an offer, do not accept on the spot. You don't even have to negotiate on the spot. Say, *"thank you so much for this opportunity! I need to take some time to review the offer (you can say with your partner, mentor, etc. if you don't feel comfortable leaving it open ended). Could you send me the offer in writing so I can review it?"*
  * Consider all pieces of the offer, is there more value in negotiating another part of the offer than salary?
  * If the company is unable to meet your counter offer, *this is okay.* It is good practice to always negotiate. Consider asking for a three - six month review to re-evaluate compensation.
