- After Turing:
	- Build out a 40 hour week divided between research, outreach, networking, and coding. Ideally two (2) - four (4) hours per day will be dedicated to code
	- Block these times out on your calendar to keep you moving along to the next task based on the timebox you've determine is adequate
	- Assess what worked with this schedule and what didn't at the end of each week. Make adjustments as needed
	* Design a 40 hour work week that addresses  ALL tasks 
		* Code
		* Outreach
		* Research 
		* Network

### Goal Setting
Set your long term goal first and work backwards identifying monthly, weekly and daily goals.                                                         "Accept job offer within 8 weeks of graduating from Turing." 
		1. Monthly?
			* Need at least three interviews within the first month 
		2. Weekly?
			* During Turing-need at least 2 conversations per week
			* After-Need at least 12 new conversations per week are needed
		3. Daily?
			* During-Need at least 1 cold outreach email/day
			* After-Need at least 5 cold/warm outreach emails are needed/day. 

- When is your absolute cut off for completing your job search?
- When would you realistically like to have your job search completed by?
- Based on that date, identify what needs to happen on a monthly basis to reach that date? i.e. If I want a job within six weeks after completing Turing, I would need to have at least three interviews within the first month after Turing.
- Based on the monthly goals, what would need to happen on a weekly basis to reach the monthly goals? i.e. If I want at least three interviews within the first month, I would need to have at least 12 new conversations per week.
- Based on the weekly goals, what would need to happen on a daily basis to reach the weekly goals? i.e. If I want at least 12 new conversations per week, I would need to send at least five cold/warm outreach emails per day.
- Spend thirty minutes each day and an hour each week assessing how your tasks aligned with your goals. Make adjustments as needed -- it's so important to be flexible, kind to yourself, and realistic with time.
