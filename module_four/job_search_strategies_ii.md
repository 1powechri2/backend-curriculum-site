# Job Search Strategies II

### Objectives
* Identify your top priorities in your job search 
* Devise an action plan for post-graduation (you will use this plan when meeting with Meg)
* Create a schedule for completing your goals

### Deliverable
Create a job search action plan to share with Meg for how you will approach the job search after your graduation from Turing. 

### Opening
Job searching takes work. In fact, it may as well be a full-time job in itself. In this session, we'll discuss how you can create the structure needed to keep up with your job search in an effective way. 

### Post-Graduation Scheduling
Treat your schedule as though it is a 40-hour work week and divide your time between:

* Code
* Research
* Outreach
* Networking

Ideally, two to four hours per day will be dedicated to code. 

### Goal Setting
To define your goals for your plan, first ask yourself some questions to generate your longterm goal:

- When is your absolute cut-off for completing your job search?
- When would you realistically like to have your job search completed by?

**Strategy:** After setting your longterm goal for the job search, build a backwards plan:

- 1. Set Monthly Goals: Using the date by which you'd like to complete your longterm goal, identify what needs to happen on a monthly basis to reach that date.
	Example: If I want a job within six weeks after completing Turing, I would need to have at least three interviews within the first month after Turing.
- 2. Set Weekly Goals: Based on the monthly goal, what needs to happen on a weekly basis to reach those goals?
	Example: If I want at least three interviews within the first month, I would need to have at least 12 new conversations per week.
- 3. Set Daily Goals: Based on the weekly goal, what needs to happen on a daily basis to reach the weekly goals?
	Example: If I want at least 12 new conversations per week, I would need to send at least five cold/warm outreach emails per day.

**Goal-setting Tips:** Spend thirty minutes each day and an hour each week assessing how your tasks align with your goals. Make adjustments as needed -- *it's so important to be flexible, kind to yourself, and realistic with time.*

### Tools
If you somehow made it through Turing without using a calendar of some kind, congratulations -- you'll start using one now. Block out time on your calendar for each task you'll complete based on the amount of time you think is adequate. 

At the end of the week, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. 

Put your plan into a gist to share with Meg. Here's an [example](https://gist.github.com/kjs222/7ef5e79a71eedf9d8c8d401da1e687c7) for your reference. 

Meg will send you a newsletter each week focused specifically on job searching tips. Make sure to read that newsletter and set up 1-on-1s with her regularly to discuss your search progress.
