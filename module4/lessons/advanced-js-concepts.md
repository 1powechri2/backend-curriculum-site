# Advanced JS Concepts

## Learning Goals

* Create and interact with JavaScript objects and explain their purpose
* Utilize functions as methods on JavaScript objects
* Understand the scope of `this` in JavaScript
* Explain the difference between JavaScript and jQuery
* Bind events to jQuery selectors to manipulate the DOM
* Research Array protoype methods 

## Warm Up

* How do you invoke a function in JavaScript?
* What is the equivalent of `document.querySelector('#important-information')` in jQuery?
* What does `$` stand for when writing jQuery?
* In your own words, describe an `event` in JavaScript. Give an example.

## Overview

We've briefly touched on quite a few JavaScript concepts, now is our time to dive deeper and ensure we're all on the same page about some concepts in particular. 

## JavaScript Objects

What's an object in JavaScript?
How do we interact with objects in JavaScript?
Why do we want to encapsulate properties/functions in objects?

## What is `this`?

Why is this important?
When do we want to leverage this in our code?

## jQuery vs JavaScript

What's the difference between JavaScript and jQuery?
How can we translate between the two?
Why use one over the other?

## Bind events to jQuery selectors to manipulate the DOM

What's an event? What's the DOM?
How do we select an DOM element using jQuery? 

## Array prototype methods

As you know, Ruby has many enumerable methods available to make your life as a developer more convenient. JavaScript has some similar methods available for Arrays. Research popular Array prototype methods and answer the following questions:

* What do you notice about Array prototype methods?
* How are they similar/different from Ruby enumerables?
* What do you think a prototype is
