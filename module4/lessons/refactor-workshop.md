## Learning Goals

* Revisit and reinforce the general points and goals of refactoring.
* Communicate a technical problem.
* Recognize common mistakes and bad practices in JS.
* Develop strategies to refactor those mistakes.

## Warmup

With your Quantified Self partner, take 5 minutes to identify a chunk of code (<= 10 lines) that you *know* is smelly, but haven't had time or don't know how to refactor it.

Develop talking points for a three minute presentation that address the following:

* Why/how the code "smells"
  * What rules or conventions it violates (e.g., DRY)
* The headaches (if any) this code has introduced to your project
* How you might refactor or deal with it
* Why refactoring would be worth the time and effort

**Split speaking time evenly between you and your partner**

## Presentations

Each group present their "smellyscript" to practice technical communication (2 minutes).

## Review presented topics

## Code-along 1-2 topics

## Paired Practice

In your assigned pair (given by instructor):

1. Checkout a refactoring branch for Person A's project
2. Work on refactoring Person A's code snippet from their presentation for 20 minutes.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for Person B

## Review

With your Quantified Self partner, discuss the following (3 minutes):

  * How your workshop pair approached refactoring
  * Your main takeaway from today's workshop
