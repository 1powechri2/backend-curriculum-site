[//]: (For Instructors:)
[//]: (There is an old version of this lesson that uses webpack. Just peek at the Git history)

Goals
----------

-   Can write unit tests in javascript
-   Can write integration tests in javascript

Libraries covered
---------

- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - A test runner
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - An assertion library
- [mocha-phantomjs](https://github.com/nathanboktae/mocha-phantomjs) - A way to run Mocha tests in the headless browser, PhantomJS
- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) - We'll use it for interacting with our DOM

Test Type Review
-----------

- Why test at all?
- What are the different types of tests?
- Why would we use one over the other?

Our Starter Repo
-------------

To get us started, clone down a fresh copy of the [Quantified Self Starter Kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/quantified-self-os). To clone it into a folder named for this lesson use this command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/quantified-self-os.git testing-in-javascript
```

Mocha - the test runner
-------------

Mocha has one job, to run your tests. It doesn't even do assertions. We'll get to that in a minute.

Mocha gives you a few functions right off the bat. You might recognize them if you're used to using RSpec:

```js
  describe()
  context()
  it()
```

They're used similarly to RSpec. The biggest different how you pass a block to the function. Since there isn't a `do...end` in JavaScript, we pass a "callback" function:

```js
describe("Something that I'm describing", function(){
  context("That thing under some context", function(){
    it("does a thing", function(){

    });
  });
});
```

For future reference: If you're familiar with ES6 [Arrow Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), these will make your callbacks slightly less verbose. I'm not going to bother with them for this lesson.

Save the above text in a file named `test/test.js`. Add your new test file to `test/test-template.html`. Then run:

```
$ open test/test-template.html
```

You should see something like

```
Something that I'm describing
  That thing under some context
    âœ“ does a thing


1 passing (8ms)
```

As a quick note: `describe()` and `context()` are not necessary. Typically, you'll want at least a `describe()` block to tell us what it is you're testing, but can omit context if you don't think it's necessary.

A popular assertion library for JavaScript is called [Chai](http://chaijs.com/). This is what we're going to use. It's already been added to the test template.

Modify your `test.js` to the following:

```js
it("can assert true", function(){
  assert(true, 'TRUE IS FALSE! UP IS DOWN! DAY IS NIGHT!');
});
```

Like RSpec and minitest, I can have an optional message as part of my assertion which will be displayed if the assertion fails. If `true` is somehow false, something has seriously gone wrong.

When you refresh your test page, you should see the test pass.

Let's try out a few more of Chai's assertions.

```js
describe("Chai Assertions Sandbox", function(){
  it("can assert true", function(){
    assert(true);
  });

  it("can assert 1 is 1", function(){
    assert.equal(1, 1);
  });

  it("can assert 2 is not 3", function(){
    assert.notEqual(2, 3);  
  });

  it("can assert that something is a given data type", function(){
    assert.isNumber(42);
    assert.isObject({answer: 42});
    assert.isArray([1,2,3,4]);
    var thingIHaventDefined;
    assert.isUndefined(thingIHaventDefined);
  });
});
```

#### `equal`, `strictEqual` and `deepEqual`

Equality in JavaScript is funky. `1 == true` but not `1 === true`. `'3' == 3` but not `'3' === 3`. `assert.equal` will compare using double equals (`==`), and `assert.strictEqual` will compare using triple equals(`===`).

`deepEqual` is used for arrays and objects. In the deep underpinnings of JavaScript, each time you define an array, it's a different array. So `[1,2,3,4] == [1,2,3,4]` will always return false. `deepEqual` will compare each value in an array, or each key/value pair in an object. Let's add the following to our sandbox:

```js
    it("can compare two arrays that contain the same values", function(){
      var actualArray = [1,2,3,4];
      assert.deepEqual(actualArray, [1,2,3,4]);
    })

    it("can compare two objects that contain the same key/value pairs", function(){
      var actualObject = {name: "Nate", module: 4};
      assert.deepEqual(actualObject, {name: "Nate", module: 4});
    })
```

Unit testing
--------------------

For our purposes, unit testing is verifying that a function will return a certain value given certain inputs. Unit tests are great for functions that perform logic for you, but don't involve user interaction directly. Here's an example:

```js
describe("We can square a number", function(){
  it("returns 4 when I pass it 2", function(){
    assert.equal(square(2), 4);
  });
});
```

We're testing that when I pass the function `square()` a value of `2`, then I get a return value of `4`. Since we're using TDD, we don't yet have an implementation of `square()`, so we need to build one. We could define `square()` in the test file itself, but that doesn't make it very portable.

Let's create `lib/square.js`. Then we can reference that file in our test HTML by adding this to our `<head>`:

```HTML
<script src="../lib/square.js"></script>
```

Now, make the test pass.

### A few more useful mocha features

-   Just like RSpec, and even Minitest, Mocha supports `before()`, `beforeEach()`, `after()` and `afterEach()` inside of a `describe()` or `context()`.
-   If you'd like to skip a test, you can mark it as pending by changing `it()` to `xit()`.

Let's integrate
-------------

So, what do we need to do to successfully automate our integration tests?

### Break it down

- Create our setup conditions
- Access the page that has our features
- Interact with the page that has our features
- Determine the current state of things
- Be able to compare the actual state of things with our expected state of things
- Clean up any changes that were made

Here's the tools we're going to use for each of these:

- **mocha (before and beforeEach)**: Create our setup conditions
- **an iframe**: Access the page that has our features
- **jQuery (.click, .trigger)**: Interact with the page that has our features
- **jQuery (.html, .text, .attr, etc)**: Determine the current state of things
- **chai (assert)**: Be able to compare the actual state of things with our expected state of things
- **mocha (after and afterEach)**: Clean up any changes that were made

### Build it up

```js
describe('#create-form', function() {
  var $;

  before(function(){
    $ = document.getElementById("foods-frame").contentWindow.$;
  })

  beforeEach(function() {
    //Clear out all the things
    $('#food-list tbody').html('');
    $('#create-form input').val('');
    $('.validation-error').html('');
  });

  context('validations', function() {

    it('will tell me if I fail to enter a name', function() {
      $('#calories-field input').val('35');
      $('#add-food').click();
      var nameValidationContent = $("#name-field .validation-error").text();
      assert.equal(nameValidationContent, "Please Enter a Name");
    });

    it('will tell me if I fail to enter calories', function() {
      $('#name-field input').val('Banana');
      $('#add-food').click();
      var caloriesValidationContent = $("#calories-field .validation-error").text();
      assert.equal(caloriesValidationContent, "Please Enter Calories");
    });

    it('will be nice to me if I do everything correctly', function() {
      $('#name-field input').val('Banana');
      $('#calories-field input').val('35');
      $('#add-food').click();

      var nameValidationContent = $("#name-field .validation-error").text();
      assert.equal(nameValidationContent, "");

      var caloriesValidationContent = $("#calories-field .validation-error").text();
      assert.equal(caloriesValidationContent, "");
    });

  });
});
```

How are we using each of the parts in the breakdown in the test above?

Now try writing another test for this user story: 


### Some hints as you continue

- Using jQuery, there's nothing as nice as `.fill`. We have to trigger each keydown and pass in the key you're pressing. I recommend writing a function that will take a string, and fire a keydown for each character in the string. I think this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/832121/4075893) spells out the details pretty well
- The code in the `before` function gives you access to jQuery on the page you're testing, but you may need to do similar stuff to get access to other things, like `localStorage`.

Let's integrate
-------------

What about when we want to test user interactions with the application. We're going to bring in a new tool called [Selenium](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/webdriver_exports_WebDriver.html).

Selenium solves a similar problem to Capybara. It allows you to visit pages, interact with them, and inspect the page in order to assert things against your application.

Capybara has it's own built in assertions with `expect`, but we'll continue to use Chai for our assertions. Instead, we extract values from the page with Selenium, and then write assertions against those

I've added the packages you need to your package.json file already (chromedriver, webdriverjs and selenium-webdriver), but selenium runs on java, and you may need to install the JDK. If `javac -version` in your terminal succeeds, you're good to go. If it fails, [download the JDK here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Now that you know the basics of mocha and chai, let's look at a full selenium test, and break it down:

```js
var assert    = require('chai').assert;
var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
var test      = require('selenium-webdriver/testing');

test.describe('testing ideabox', function() {
  var driver;
  this.timeout(10000);

  test.beforeEach(function() {
    driver = new webdriver.Builder()
      .forBrowser('chrome')
      .build();
  })

  test.afterEach(function() {
    driver.quit();
  })


  test.it('should allow me to add a title and a description', function() {

    driver.get('http://idea-box-jhun.herokuapp.com/');

    var title = driver.findElement({id: 'idea-name'});
    var description = driver.findElement({id: 'idea-body'});
    title.sendKeys('this is a title');

    title.getAttribute('value').then(function(value) {
      assert.equal(value, 'this is a title');
    });

    description.sendKeys('this is a description');

    description.getAttribute('value').then(function(value) {
      assert.equal(value, 'this is a description');
    });

  });

  test.it('should allow me to create an idea', function() {

    driver.get('http://idea-box-jhun.herokuapp.com/');

    var title = driver.findElement({id: 'idea-name'});
    var description = driver.findElement({id: 'idea-body'});
    var submitButton = driver.findElement({id: 'create-idea'});

    title.sendKeys('a new title');
    description.sendKeys('a new description');
    submitButton.click();

    driver.sleep(1000);

    driver.findElement({id: 'ideaname'}).getText().then(function(textValue) {
      assert.equal(textValue, "a new title");
    });

    driver.findElement({id: 'delete-idea'}).click();

  })

});
```

Let's start with our `require`s

```js
var assert    = require('chai').assert;
var webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
var test      = require('selenium-webdriver/testing');
// ...
```

-   You should recognize that we're using Chai's assertions again.
-   `webdriver` is really where the magic happens. We're going to be calling a lot from this object.
-   `test` kind of replaces Mocha for us. We use selenium's `test` object because it handles asynchronous code better, but it's still technically running within Mocha.

Moving on:

```js
// ...
test.describe('testing ideabox', function() {
  var driver;
  this.timeout(10000);
// ...
```


-   Since we're using selenium's test runner, we have to preface our `describe()` and `it()` with `test`.
-   We're setting up a variable `driver` for the whole block
-   The default timeout is 2000 milliseconds, which we'll run out of quickly with all the browsing we're going to be doing.

```js
  test.beforeEach(function() {
    driver = new webdriver.Builder()
    .forBrowser('chrome')
    build();
  });
  test.afterEach(function() {
    driver.quit();
  });
```

Here we're starting Chrome before each test, and quitting it after each test. I've found this gives me the most consistent test results.

Then there's the tests themselves. The structure should look pretty familiar, but let's cover some of these functions.

#### driver.get()

This just visits a page in selenium.

#### driver.findElement()

This allows you to actually select elements on the page. In some docs/tutorials/snippets, you'll see something like `driver.findElement(By.id('some-id'))`, but I've used the "hash syntax" in my tests.

#### click() and sendKeys()

These are used to actually interact with elements on the page

#### getText() and getAttribute()

```js
driver.findElement({id: 'ideaname'}).getText().then(function(textValue) {
  assert.equal(textValue, "a new title");
});
```

This is how you get some information about your elements. Because of some decisions made by the selenium team, basically everything is a promise. This means instead of returning values, these functions return promises, and the only way to get the values is to call `then()` on them, and name the variable for the value in the anonymous function parameters. But once you get the pattern, it's pretty straight forward.


These are just a few of the functions you can use, but probably the most common ones. There are a lot more [in the docs](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebDriver.html). The docs seem intimidating at first, but stick with them. They're consistent and have little snippets throughout.


### Notes for working with selenium

-   I've been visiting a production link for proof of concept, but usually you'll want to run your tests on your dev server. Don't forget to run your dev server in another tab before you run your tests.
-   When googling, make don't google "selenium" or even "selenium javascript". You'll just get stuff in other languages. Put "webdriverjs" in your search query.
-   You might be missing something like a Database Cleaner. You can [use selenium to execute](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebDriver.html#executeScript) `localStorage.clear()`, maybe in your `beforeEach()`.
