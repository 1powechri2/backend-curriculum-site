Capstone Project
==============

Learning Goals
------------
*   Students use an agile process to turn acceptance requirements into deployed software *(mastery)*
*   Students estimate complexity of user stories *(functional)*
*   Students translate acceptance requirements into user stories that are ready to be worked on *(mastery)*
*   Students verify acceptance requirements using automated testing *(mastery)*
*   Students document intent and usage of their code for effective collaboration *(functional)*
*   Students use pull requests to document discussion about features *(functional)*
*   Students divide applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams *(functional)*
*   Students build applications that execute in development, test, CI and production environments *(functional)*
*   Students apply accessibility best practices when building their applications *(functional)*
*   Students explore and implement new concepts learned in class this module or on their own *(mastery)*

Overview
------------

The Capstone Project will last two weeks and will consist of students meaningful, publishable work of their choosing. An instructor will be assigned to each student and act as the Technical Lead.

Technical Expectations
---------------------

We would like to give you a fair amount of freedom on this project. We want you to bulid something that you're excited about, and that you're proud of. These are a few requirements you should consider when pitching and building your project:

*   You build something usable. Your should be comfortable publishing your project by the time it's due in week 6. A spike or exploration into a new concept without a clear deliverable won't be accepted.
*   You must apply at least two new techniques. New is something from the 4th module (OOJS, Security, Environments, React), or something extra-curricular. Something not taught in the Turing Back-end engineering program.
	-   Since accessibility is already in the rubric, it doesn't count as a new topic
	-   If you use something cool for your documentation (swagger, JSON-API, etc), I would count that.

Structure of each week
------------

Each team should work together to plan daily stand-up's. Let your Technical Lead know when these stand-up's will take place so they can attend as needed.

Every Tuesday afternoon, the Product Owner will talk with their team about the set of user stories to be implemented for that sprint. The sprint will start Tuesday and end Friday at 10 AM.

At the culmunation of the project (Friday of Week 5), each team will spend 5 minutes demoing their project to the entire class. All team members should present a piece of the project.

After the demos, each team will meet with their Technical Lead who will evaluate their progress via the rubric below.

During the first day of each sprint, each Technical Lead will meet with the Product Owner of each team to walk through the next set of stories. The Product Owner is responsible for brainstorming what these stories are with their team. The Technical Lead is responsible for helping guide the Product Owner and estimate how long each story will take. 

The Project Manager is responsible for communicating to the Technical Lead throughout each sprint if the team is not going at a pace to finish the set of stories by the end of the sprint.

All classes (except for PD classes) scheduled during week 5 and Friday of week 4 are optional unless otherwise stated, depending on the team you choose. Feel free to audit classes in other modules and programs:
