# Capstone Project

## Learning Goals
* Students use an agile process to turn acceptance requirements into deployed software *(mastery)*
* Students estimate complexity of user stories *(functional)*
* Students translate acceptance requirements into user stories that are ready for work *(mastery)*
* Students verify acceptance requirements using automated testing *(mastery)*
* Students document intent and usage of their code for effective collaboration *(functional)*
* Students use pull requests to organize discussion about features *(functional)*
* Students divide applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams *(functional)*
* Students build applications that execute in development, test, CI and production environments *(functional)*
* Students apply accessibility best practices when building their applications *(functional)*
* Students explore and implement new concepts learned in class or on their own *(mastery)*

## Overview

The Capstone Project will last three weeks and will consist of students working in teams of 4+ students. Teams may choose to work on existing Turing internal projects listed [here](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects_overview) or they can choose to take a team member's existing personal project and build on it.

## Roles
* Each group with assign the following roles:
	* Project Manager
	* Product Owner
* An instructor will be assigned to each group and act as the Technical Lead.

## Structure of each week

Each team should work together to plan daily stand-up's. Let your Technical Lead know when these stand-up's will take place so they can attend as needed.

Every Monday afternoon, the Product Owner will talk with their team about the set of user stories to be implemented for that sprint. The sprint will start Monday and end Thursday at 3 PM.

At 3 PM on Thursday, each team will spend 3 minutes demoing their project to the entire class. A different team member will present at the end of each sprint.

After the demos, each team will meet with their Technical Lead who will evaluate their progress via the rubric below.

During class on Friday, each Technical Lead will meet with the Product Owner of each team to walk through the next set of stories. The Product Owner is responsible for brainstorming what these stories are with their team. The Technical Lead is responsible for helping guide the Product Owner and estimate how long each story will take. The Product Owner is responsible for communicating to the Technical Lead throughout each sprint if the team is not going at a pace to finish the set of stories by the end of the sprint.

During weeks 4 and 5, all classes (except for PD classes) are optional unless otherwise stated, depending on the team you choose. Feel free to audit classes in other modules and programs:
