Capstone Project
==============

Learning Goals
------------
*   Students use an agile process to turn acceptance requirements into deployed software *(mastery)*
*   Students estimate complexity of user stories *(functional)*
*   Students translate acceptance requirements into user stories that are ready to be worked on *(mastery)*
*   Students verify acceptance requirements using automated testing *(mastery)*
*   Students document intent and usage of their code for effective collaboration *(functional)*
*   Students use pull requests to document discussion about features *(functional)*
*   Students divide applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams *(functional)*
*   Students build applications that execute in development, test, CI and production environments *(functional)*
*   Students apply accessibility best practices when building their applications *(functional)*
*   Students explore and implement new concepts learned in class this module or on their own *(mastery)*

Overview
------------

The Capstone Project will last two weeks and will consist of students working individually to create something that's meaningful following the guidelines.

Roles
------------

*   An instructor will be assigned to each group and act as the Technical Lead

Structure of each week
------------

Each student will submit a project proposal at the end of the "soft launch" [here](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1701-b/4module/capstone_projects/project_proposal.md). Technical Lead's will give feedback on the scope of the project either via Github, Slack message, or in person.

At the beginning of each week, each student will set their sprint (aka what they want to accomplish that week). Throughout the week, each student should be tagging their Technical Lead in PR's if they have questions or want feedback on any code they've written. 

Halfway through the project, each student will spend 2 minutes demoing their project to the entire class. Students will also demo their projects at the end of the project in week six.

Halfway through the project, each student will meet with their Technical Lead who will evaluate their progress via the rubric below.

The student is responsible for communicating to the Technical Lead throughout each sprint if they are not going at a pace to finish the set of stories by the end of the sprint.


Rubric
------------

On the Friday of each sprint (each week) we'll use the below rubric to evaluate and give feedback on your project progress. The first Friday, we'll go through the rubric but it will be a "trial" evaluation. The second Friday will be the scores that you'll put in your portfolio.

### 1. Project Management

*   4: Tracker also documents feature related discussions
*   3: Team is using well formatted user stories and moving cards through each status in realtime
*   2: Team has used Tracker as a respository of information
*   1: Tracker shows little to no use

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Team is proactive in understanding scope and is able to commit to stories before starting the sprint
*   3: Team is able to set and update expectations so that there are no surprises on the last day of the sprint
*   2: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed at the end of the sprint, but has a plan to get them done
*   1: Team does not have agreed upon stories completed, and has no plan to complete them

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
*   3: Project exhibits maintainable well divided code. Developers are able to speak to architecture and implementation decisions.
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions.
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of MVC.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques that were new this week.
*   3: Project has implemented one major technique that was new this week.
*   2: Project has a implementation in progress of one major technique that has not been previously attempted.
*   1: Project does not implement new techniques.

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Project also features a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   3: Project features easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Project features barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   1: Project has insufficient documentation

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Team has expertly implemented features to follow accessibility best practices.
*   3: Team has implemented code to increase accessibility.
*   2: Team has considered accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them.
*   1: Team has not considered accessibility issues.
