## Themes

* Establishing workflow, dev environment, staging
* Extracting functionality into components/services
* Implementing authentication via OAuth
* Revisiting Ruby techniques
* Building JavaScript fundamentals towards implementation in S2

## Expectations for Students

* Get the application running on each member’s development machine
* Get the application running in staging on a VPS or Heroku
* Asses/explore existing code in the app
* Identify at least one component to extract into a gem/component or service
* Look for opportunities to improve configuration via initializers and environment variables
* Integrate OmniAuth into the app if not already present
* Implement an authorization system if not already present
* Setup and make use of a project management system
* Begin using strong story/code/PR/review/merge/deploy cycles

## Instructional Sessions - Week 1

### JavaScript without a Browser

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Needs Planning

There are surely existing materials somewhere, but the idea here is to make sure students understand how JS gets run without a browser. Would be a good time for some history/context of V8.

### Workflow & Communication

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Needs Planning

Put together a set of expectations of how the project teams will communicate: standups, stories, project management, etc

### Object-Oriented JavaScript

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Ready

There is an existing lesson plan to be reviewed.

### Professional Code Environments

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Needs Planning

Recapping what goes into a local dev environment, staging, production. PaaS vs VPS.

### Debugging JavaScript

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Needs Review

I believe there are existing materials, but they’re browser-centric. Can they be bent to non-browser usage?

### Characterization & Acceptance Testing

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Needs Review

There are existing materials in the JSL services tutorial sequence, but will need to pull out the relevant parts and look for any version/update issues

### PS: Flower Exercise Follow-Up

* Staff: Allison
* Status: Ready

### OAuth Revisited

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Light Planning

Short session that will recap how OAuth works, the role of OmniAuth, OmniAuth Strategies, etc

### Enumerables in JavaScript

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Light Planning

Pull together components from the existing Array Prototype less, Lodash lesson, etc.

## Instructional Sessions - Week 2

### Extracting Components & Services

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Light Planning

Extract materials from larger JSL tutorials. Consider assigning parts as homework.

### Isolating Dependencies with Wrappers

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Light Planning

Extract materials from larger JSL tutorials. Consider assigning parts as homework.

### PS: Negotiating

* Staff: Lia
* Status: Ready

### Linked Lists in JS

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Ready

Nate’s done this before, so it should be ready to go.

### Testing in a World of Services

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Needs Planning

Dealing with the mocking of services, possibly offering reusable mock libraries in the model of omniauth.

### Pub/Sub is Crazy Awesome

* Staff: Jeff
* Status: Light Planning

Review the existing Pub/Sub tutorial and revise it into a lighter lesson, possibly with stations/small groups.

### BST in JS

* Staff: Andrew
* Status: Ready

Nate’s done this before, so it should be ready to go.

## Preparation To-Dos

* Check-in with Lia/Allison about PD sessions they were already planning to teach and make sure the schedule is aligned
* Determine which of our professional skills sessions are/aren’t covered by their sessions
* Schedule any PSkills sessions that are not covered
* Make a work plan to develop the lesson plans as needed
* Decide on the role of “homework” outside of project work
* Finalize thinking about “Art” vs “Practice” and whether that language will be used with * students
* Schedule an inception meeting with each project team
* Recruit/assign mentors to each project
* Communicate mentor expectations/parameters to the teams and mentors
* DONE: Lay out first draft class sessions for this sprint (weeks 1 & 2)
* DONE: Assign each technical class session to either Jeff or Andrew
* DONE: Review the lessons from the first two weeks to determine what we do and don’t have ready
* DONE: Pick the three projects
* DONE: Determine the student three teams
