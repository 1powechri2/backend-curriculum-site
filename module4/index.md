## Module 4 Scope and Sequence

### Purpose

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

### Defining Success

Students who successfully complete Module 4 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills, Core Technical Skills, and a set of Elective Technical skills. [These skills are broken down in detail here](success).

### Projects

The module is primarily oriented around six-week team projects. [Find more details about the projects themselves here](projects_overview).

For the November 16-January 17 inning, students work in the following groups:

* Monocle: Susi Irwin & Brendan Dillon & Dan Broadbent & Ryan David Workman & Nate Anderson
* Enroll: Sonia Gupta & Brian Heim & David Davydov & Jean Joeris & Raphael Barbo
* Census: Bryan Goss & Calaway & Jesse Spevack & Jasmin Hudacsek

### Course Plan

The course and class sessions are centered around the three sprints of the projects:

* [Sprint 1: Development/Production Environments, JavaScript Fundamentals, and Introduction to Services](sprint_1)
* [Sprint 2: Asynchronous Execution, SQL & Database Performance, and Real-World REST](sprint_2)
* [Sprint 3: Integrating Experimental Technologies](sprint_3)
