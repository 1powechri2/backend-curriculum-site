### Purpose

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

### Defining Success

Students who successfully complete Module 4 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills, Core Technical Skills, and a set of Elective Technical skills. [These skills are broken down in detail here](success).

### Projects

1. [Quantified Self](./projects/quantified-self/quantified-self) - students start by building a front end in JavaScript that connects to an existing Rails API. Then they will re-build the back end with Node, Express, and Knex (so cool, right?). This project lasts the first three weeks.
2. [Capstone Project](http://backend.turing.io/module4/capstone_project_overview) - this is a personal project students work on weeks three to six. Students will put everything they've learned during their time at Turing into this final project.
3. Open Source Project - this group project will take place in week six. More information to come.
