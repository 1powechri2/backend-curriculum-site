## Overview

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

## Learning Goals

Lessons and student assessments will be geared towards the learning goals outlined [here](./learning_goals). Note that not all learning goals are created equally. For some, we expect that students will have absolute mastery of the skill described. Others, we only expect that a student will have a passing familiarity.

## Graduation Requirements

Students will be expected to meet the requirements outlined [here](./graduation_requirements) in order to graduate from Module 4.
