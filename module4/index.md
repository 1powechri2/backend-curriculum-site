## Module 4 Scope and Sequence

### Overview

Module 4 builds upon the skills learned to prepare students for the real world of software through a deeper understanding of choices and tradeoffs. Students dive into JavaScript by exploring object-oriented practices and frameworks. We strengthen our understanding of the difference between `client-side` and `server-side`. The overarching intent of module 4 is to prepare students for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating the every step. Module 4 should be the capstone, a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of.

### Big Goals

By the end of the module students will be able to:

* Evaluate choices that they make in software and understand the tradeoffs
* Revise an application to be web scale
* Build a purely client-side application
* Test and build a JavaScript application
* Understand and practice working in an Agile workflow on a team
* Have the confidence and to adapt to new technologies and teams
