### Purpose

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

### Defining Success

Students who successfully complete Module 4 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills, Core Technical Skills, and a set of Elective Technical skills. [These skills are broken down in detail here](success).

### Projects

Your first project is [Quantified Self](./projects/quantified-self/quantified-self). You'll start by building a back-end API to serve and persist your data. Then you'll build the front end to interact with the data. You'll use node and the express framework to build your API, and a heavy dose of jQuery to build out your front-end behavior.

Starting week 2, you'll be making small contributions to open source. You can find out more [here](./lessons/contributing_to_open_source)

Weeks 4&5 will be spent working on your capstone projects.
