## Module 4 Scope and Sequence

### Purpose

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

### Broad Learning Goals

- Give students confidence to adapt to new technologies and teams
  - Students will test and build an application in a new language
  - Students will understand and practice working in an Agile workflow on a team
  - Students will apply the concepts previously learned in new contexts
  - Students will be working in "brownfield development" situations
- Students should be able to provide value in technical conversations and decisions
  - Students will be able to evaluate choices that they make in designing software and understand the tradeoffs
  - Students will understand and be able to speak to the basics of software architecture
- Students should be able to differentiate with respect to career goals
  - Students will be able to define their skills in context of the web application pipeline
- Students will polish their professional skills and apply them to the job hunt
  - Students will be able to balance and prioritize their time and energy
  - Students will keep up with the professional development curriculum


### Defining Success

Students who successfully complete Module 4 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills, Core Technical Skills, and a set of Elective Technical skills. [These skills are broken down in detail here](success).

We have enumerated a [list of commitments](commitments) for students and instructors throughout the module. This is in addition to the regular expectations we introduced a couple innings ago, and I can't find right now. Standby.

### Projects

Your first project is [Quantified Self](projects/quantified-self). It's a pair project lasting two weeks, and will thus overlap for one week with your main project.

The module is primarily oriented around five-week team projects. [Find more details about the projects themselves here](projects_overview).

### Assessment - 1608

You will be given a mock assessment in Week 4. [You can see the assessment here](https://gist.github.com/neight-allen/15b1273e067e359892d686123d0bb585)

The mock assessment gist also includes a section covering the topics that will be on the final that are not on the mock.

### Course Plan

***THIS IS OLD***

The course and class sessions are centered around the three sprints of the projects:

* [Sprint 1: Development/Production Environments, JavaScript Fundamentals, and Introduction to Services](sprint_1)
* [Sprint 2: Asynchronous Execution, SQL & Database Performance, and Real-World REST](sprint_2)
* [Sprint 3: Integrating Experimental Technologies](sprint_3)

### Addendum
