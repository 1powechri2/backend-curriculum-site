### Purpose

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns and processes that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.

### Defining Success

Students who successfully complete Module 4 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills, Core Technical Skills, and a set of Elective Technical skills. [These skills are broken down in detail here](success).

### Projects

Your first project is [Quantified Self](./projects/quantified-self/quantified-self). It's an all front-end pair project for the first week.

Your [second project](./projects/quantified-self/quantified-self-back-end is an extension of your first week. You'll build the back-end and wire it up to the front end.

The next three weeks will be spent working on your capstone projects. We're still working out details
