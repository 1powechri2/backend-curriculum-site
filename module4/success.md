## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

### Independent Work

*Expected*: Independent work for M4 will consist primarily of contributing to external Open Source in Weeks 2 - 6:

* Reproduce and confirm or contradict one bug report
* Submit one sizable/difficult or two smaller/moderate code-centric pull requests that are worth merging
* Submit one documentation patch (README, CONTRIBUTING, code documentation, etc)
* Write a single blog post that explains the whole process

*Expected*: Students, if they worked independently in Week 2, document the feedback from their instructor for their work.

*Optional*: Students are encouraged to include the results of their in-class work and tutorials.

### Group Work

*Expected*: Students, as a pair, document the results of their project from Week 1.

*Expected*: Students, if they worked in a pair in Week 2, document the feedback from their instructor for.

*Expected*: Students, as a project team, are responsible for delivering all scheduled feature cards *in the primary project* by the end of Sprint 3 (Week 5).

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by **9AM on Monday of Week 6** unless otherwise noted though it is suggested that you send them earlier if possible. All deliverables except for your Census account check should be submitted in the [Career Development deliverables submissions folder](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions).

* Summaries of at least 6 "cold outreach" contacts. You are asked to complete two by the end of week 2, two by the end of week 3, and two by the end of week 4 with a summary of all contacts submitted on **Monday of week 5** and following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md)
* Provide a link to your completed Turing portfolio, complete with your name, photo, description, 3 projects, and resume
* Documentation of practice interview participation using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_practice_reflection_guidelines.md).
* Ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account

Not required for your portfolio or graduation, but is required for continued job support:

* Completed action plan for the post-grad job search -- *template is forthcoming*. Check with Allison if you have questions.

### Feedback & Community

As stewards of the larger Turing community, Module 4 students are expected to **complete at least two** of the following:

* lead or co-lead the week 5 Gear Up session for lower modules
* lead or co-lead a Friday Spike session
* deliver any session at a meetup or conference
* pair three or more times with students in lower modules
* contribute in a meaningful way to the project of a student/team *not* in your module

OR

* Facilitate a Gear-up session that you've designed with other Mod 4 students

When documenting your community contribution, say a few words about the experience.

### Portfolio

To document all of the work you've done this module, include each of the items above in your portfolio, which is due on Thursday of Week 6.

### Turing Story Presentation

On Thursday of Week 6, you'll present the story of your journey at Turing to your classmates and staff.

Your presentation...

- should be about 4 minutes
- should include the time leading up to Turing
- should include your time at Turing
- should include the trajectory you're on as you start your new career
- should include thoughtful reflection and describe how you've grown and changed
- can include a slide deck, or any other visual aids you'd like

After you present, instructors will ask you a couple questions, mostly to dig into things we found interesting about your story. There's not specific answers we'll be looking for.

If you're unsure how to cover your time at Turing, a common pattern is to simply talk about each module. Talk about your favorite project, or what the biggest takeaway was for you, or just a fun story from that module.

You're required to present, but there's no grade. As long as you get up and speak, you've met the requirement.

## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B4 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

Each of the following skills is covered in the curriculum, and most are covered by an assessment or project rubric.

## Professional Skills

### Technical Communication

* Students formulate questions by synthesizing what was expected vs what was observed *(mastery)*
* Students explain intent and execution of their code *(mastery)*
* Students document intent and usage of their code for effective collaboration *(functional)*
* Students use pull requests to organize discussion about features *(functional)*
* Students implement feedback from a code review to improve quality *(functional)*
* Students provide feedback in the form of a code review to improve quality and share knowledge *(familiarity)*

## Core Technical Skills
