Success in B4 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the following concepts:

## Professional Skills

### Project Management

* The process by which business requirements are turned into acceptance requirements
* How acceptance requirements are turned into stories and feature requirements
* How stories are estimated and workload/schedule determined
* How pull requests are used to organize discussion about features
* How code review is used to ensure a uniformity of style, increase quality, and share knowledge
* How project management tools are used to communicate across technical teams and stakeholders/clients

### Open Source

* Students are able to create pull requests
* Students are able to use PRs for ongoing conversation in a logical/professional manner
* Student has at least one pull request accepted to a public, non-Turing project

### Interpersonal Skills

* Asking high quality questions of people or StackOverflow
* Effective collaboration techniques for remote teams
* Effective communication around code, explaining what it does and why

### Employment Skills

* (forthcoming)

## Core Technical Skills

### Architecture

* How applications are divided into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams
* How components of responsibility can be extracted to their own applications/services
* How outside service can be abstracted to provide flexibility
* How we understand and define contracts between services

### Ruby

* Students are able to make excellent use of Ruby at least as well as a Module 1 graduate
* Students are able to mix Ruby fundamentals into web applications to do things like: create POROs wrapping external services / data sources, build a Ruby gem

### Rails

* Students are able to make use of outside data sources / services from a Rails application
* Students are able to make use of initializers and environment variables to control the configuration of an application
* Students practice decomposing business processes into Railsâ€™ REST pattern
* Students practice building a user authentication system based on an external OAuth provider
* Students practice implementing an organized user authorization system (ex: cancancan)

### JavaScript Essentials

* Students write instructions with basic data types like strings, integers, and floats
* Students use basic array functions to store and retrieve data
* Students use a library to execute collection functionality (ex: lodash)
* Students create and use anonymous functions
* Students create and use named functions
* Students create and use functions with optional parameters
* Students organize functions into objects
* Students create instances of objects both with and without constructors
* Students make effective use of this in multiple contexts

### JavaScript in the Browser

* Students use jQuery to attach code to events including document-ready and click
* Students search the DOM using CSS-style selectors
* Students read and manipulate page content via JavaScript
* Students fetch and inject content without refreshing the page (ex: AJAX)
* Students implement a real-time technology to update page content without user action (ex: websockets, pusher)

### PostgreSQL & SQL

* Students write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM
* Students intelligently structure/normalize data so as to maintain reasonable performance as the data size increases
* Students perform basic data backups and restorations
* Students use the CLI to review the status of their database (ex: list databases, tables, table structure)
* Students use the CLI to execute SQL instructions
* Students diagnose and improve the performance of slow queries
* Students explain the appropriate use of and implement indices

## Elective Technical Skills

### Node

* Students implement a stand-alone service with Node
* Students read and write to a database from Node
* Students secure the interaction between their Rails and Node applications
* Students use the node package system to manage dependencies

### Redis

* Students use Redis as a store of recent or computed data
* Students use Redis as a communication tunnel between two separate processes
* Students use Redis as a pub/sub communication tool between multiple processes
* Students implement strategies to deal with Redis running out of available memory
* Students use Redis from multiple application contexts (ex: Ruby, Rails, Node)
* Students use the Redis CLI to debug and demonstrate functionality

### Servers

* Startup
* Installation
* Scaling/Replication
* Deployment
* Cron

### Front-End JavaScript Framework

Possibilities: React, Angular, Ember

### Alternate Platforms

Possibilities: Swift/iOS, React Native, Electron

### Third Backend Language

Possibilities: Elixir, Java, Scala, Go
