## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

Assessment requirements will be provided on the first week of the module.

### Independent Work

*Expected*: Students will [contribute to external Open Source](./lessons/contributing_to_open_source) in Weeks 2 - 6 as a side project.

*Optional*: Students are encouraged to include the results of their in-class work and tutorials.

### Group Work

*Expected*: Students, as a pair, document the results of their Quantified Self project.

*Expected*: Students, as a project team, are responsible for passing rubric scores by the end of Personal Project Sprint 2 (Week 5).

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by **9AM on Monday of Week 6** unless otherwise noted though it is suggested that you send them earlier if possible. All deliverables except for your Census account check should be submitted in the [Career Development deliverables submissions folder](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions).

*   Summaries of at least 6 "cold outreach" contacts. You are asked to submit the summaries by **Monday of week 5** and follow these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md)
*   Add two projects to your Turing portfolio and add a link to your Turing portfolio.
*   Document practice interview participation using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_practice_reflection_guidelines.md).
*   Completed action plan for the post-grad job search [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md).

### Feedback & Community

As stewards of the larger Turing community, Module 4 students are expected to facilitate a Gear-up session that they've designed with other Mod 4 students.

When documenting your community contribution, say a few words about the facilitation experience.

### Portfolio

To document all of the work you've done this module, include each of the items above (except the Career Development portion) in your portfolio, which is due on Thursday of Week 6.

### Turing Story Presentation

On Thursday of Week 6, you'll present the story of your journey at Turing to your classmates and staff.

Your presentation...

-   should be about 4 minutes
-   should include the time leading up to Turing
-   should include your time at Turing
-   should include the trajectory you're on as you start your new career
-   should include thoughtful reflection and describe how you've grown and changed
-   can include a slide deck, or any other visual aids you'd like

After you present, instructors will ask you a couple questions, mostly to dig into things we found interesting about your story. There's not specific answers we'll be looking for.

If you're unsure how to cover your time at Turing, a common pattern is to simply talk about each module. Talk about your favorite project, or what the biggest takeaway was for you, or just a fun story from that module.

You're required to present, but there's no grade. As long as you get up and speak, you've met the requirement.

## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B4 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

Each of the following skills is covered in the curriculum, and most are covered by an assessment or project rubric.

* Students read form content and manipulate DOM via JavaScript *(functional)*
* Students integrate outside data sources in the browser (AJAX, local storage) *(functional)*
* Students use integration testing to verify JavaScript functionality *(functional)*

### Node & Express

* Students implement a stand-alone web service with Node and Express *(functional)*
* Students interact with SQL databases by writing raw SQL *(functional)*
* Students render views from an Express application *(familiarity)*

### JavaScript Tools and Libraries
