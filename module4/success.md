## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

### Independent Work

*Expected*: Independent work for M4 will consist primarily of contributing to external Open Source in Weeks 2 - 6:

* Reproduce and confirm or contradict one bug report
* Submit one sizable/difficult or two smaller/moderate code-centric pull requests that are worth merging
* Submit one documentation patch (README, CONTRIBUTING, code documentation, etc)
* Write a single blog post that explains the whole process

*Optional*: Students are encouraged to include the results of their in-class work and tutorials.

### Group Work

*Expected*: Students, as a pair, document the results of their project from Weeks 1 & 2.

*Expected*: Students, as a project team, are responsible for delivering all scheduled feature cards *in the primary project* by the end of Sprint 2 (Week 5).

### Career Development

The Career Development segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by **9AM on Monday of Week 6** unless otherwise noted though it is suggested that you send them earlier if possible. All deliverables except for your Census account check should be submitted in the [Career Development deliverables submissions folder](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions).

* Summaries of at least 6 "cold outreach" contacts. You are asked to complete two by the end of week 2, two by the end of week 3, and two by the end of week 4 with a summary of all contacts submitted on **Monday of week 5** and following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md)
* Provide a link to your completed Turing portfolio, complete with your name, photo, description, 3 projects, and resume
* Documentation of practice interview participation using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_practice_reflection_guidelines.md). 
* Completed action plan for the post-grad job search -- *template is forthcoming*. Check with Allison if you have questions
* Ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account

### Feedback & Community

As stewards of the larger Turing community, Module 4 students are expected to **complete at least two** of the following:

* lead or co-lead the week 5 Gear Up session for lower modules
* lead or co-lead a Friday Spike session
* deliver any session at a meetup or conference
* pair three or more times with students in lower modules
* contribute in a meaningful way to the project of a student/team *not* in your module

## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B4 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique
