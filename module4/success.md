## Graduation Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 4, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of `3` or greater in *each* category of the final assessment rubric.

### Independent Work

*Expected*: Independent work for M4 will consist primarily of contributing to external Open Source in Weeks 5 & 6:

* Reproduce and confirm or contradict one bug report
* Submit one sizable/difficult or two smaller/moderate code-centric pull requests that are worth merging
* Submit one documentation patch (README, CONTRIBUTING, code documentation, etc)
* Write a single blog post that explains the whole process
* Complete "[The Plan](http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/the-plan/)", which details steps you'll take to grow in the 6-12 months after Turing

*Optional*: Students are encouraged to include the results of their in-class work and tutorials.

### Group Work

*Expected*: Students, as a pair, document the results of their project from Weeks 1 & 2.

*Expected*: Students, as a project team, are responsible for delivering all scheduled feature cards *in the primary project* by the end of Sprint 2 (Week 5).

*Expected*: Students are responsible for delivering all feature cards assigned to them *in the team's side project/service* by the end of Sprint 2 (Week 5).

### Professional Skills

The Professional Skills segment is made up of several pieces, most of which are to be submitted by 9AM on Monday of Week 6 thought it is suggested that you send them earlier if possible.

* Summaries of at least 6 "cold outreach" contacts [submitted via email to Meg](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) on Tuesday 02/21. You are asked to complete two by the end of week 2, two by the end of week 3, and two by the end of week 4 with a summary of all contacts submitted to Meg on 02/21 and including the following information-> [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md)

The remainder of professional development material is as follows:

* Following up on the *Organize Your Shit* session, ensure that your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts are properly setup by linking to them in your Census account. We will run an automated check on these and send you a follow up if needed. No submission is necessary beyond putting the info in your Census account.
* Following up on the *Portfolio Tips & Tricks* tutorial, notify [Meg via email](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) that your portfolio is complete with your name, photo, description, three projects, and resume.
* Participate in at least one practice technical interview or one actual external interview. [Email Meg](mailto:mstewart@turing.io) a summary with the company, interviewer's name, and their title.

### Feedback & Community

As stewards of the larger Turing community, Module 4 students are expected to **complete at least two** of the following:

* lead or co-lead a Friday Spike session
* deliver any session at a meetup or conference
* pair three or more times with students in lower modules
* contribute in a meaningful way to the project of a student/team *not* in your module

## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B4 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique
