Session 1:
-Reflect in journal for 5 minutes on current framing of stress and how it's currently being dealt with (5 minutes) 
-Watch TED talk on stress and then discuss in small groups (25 mins total) - this could be an additional resource
-Focus on gratitude...
-Intentional listening -- share for 3 minutes uninterrupted and their partner says back to them (2-3 mins) what they heard was stressing them out, also any questions/wonderings they have; then switch
  Purpose: reflect on what's really happening in this situation; frame it as pair coaching
-Open dialogue (put up what they most want to talk about) put up on the board/display what they want to work on or situations that are particularly stressful that they want to address; then self-select into groups around that
  Examples: pairing (navigating people and code), evals, assessment with instructor, homework/workload/time management, making time for family/friends/health/personal care, 
  Goal as group: Work as a group to identify a strategy to use for combatting this stress and discuss pros/cons of that strategy
  Then come back as a whole group to share out big picture ideas
-Think about times in other parts of life when they've managed stress before; what worked well? How can you adapt that to this environment? This environment can make small things turn into bigger stresses; there are high stakes here
  -Spending time identifying the stresses of this environment in particular -- framing of what's different about being here vs. other areas of your life
-Create different options -- stations: 1. reading/reflecting individually 2. group discussions 3. other videos, etc. 
  
1. Framing - group brainstorm
2. Reflection 

Time for planning: End with a written reflection and create concrete goals for next week -- what will you do differently? How will you stay accountable? Who from this session can be your buddy?
Examples: join wellness challenge, join productivity lunch, share a goal with your project partner and allow them to help you manage it, share with family, 

Session 2:
-

Challenge:
Students not getting specific enough about what's stressing them out -- made it harder to dig into when they're at their most stressed; also not identifying how they come out of the stress
