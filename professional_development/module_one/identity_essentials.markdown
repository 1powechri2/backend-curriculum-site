title:  Identity Essentials

As you progress through Turing and slingshot into a developer career, your online identity is incredibly valuable and important to you.

Here in your early days of Turing you are under great pressure and pulled in several directions. Let's focus on establishing the *essentials* of your developer identity, then in later modules really build it out when you have great work to show off.

## The Why

Software development likes to think of itself as a meritocracy, but it's not. It's a relationship-driven field. To form relationships you need to be a person. When I meet you at a meetup and later google your name, I need to find you. I need to know that the result I find on LinkedIn is the same person I find on GitHub. I need to find your email address easily to send you a follow up. I want to stumble on your StackOverflow conversations to learn that you're a great communicator.

On the negative side, what if I can't find you? What if I get to your LinkedIn but think I must have been wrong -- you're not a developer you're still doing your old job? Or I get to your GitHub and there are subtle little signals you're not a *"real developer"*?

Let's do it right.

## Expectations

At the end of the module your portfolio will include a "Professional Skills" section. Tasks here contribute to the the expectations of that portfolio, including:

1. GitHub account properly setup
2. LinkedIn account properly setup
3. StackOverflow account properly setup

This shouldn't take a ton of work. Let's get into it.

## Essential Tasks

### Prep

Here's what you'll need to have on hand:

#### Headshot

We take one for you for a reason. If I look at this headshot I need to easily be able to recognize you in real life. That means it should be clear, recent, reasonably professional.

#### Standard Name

Government name, what your mama calls you, nickname? It doesn't really matter as long as it's *consistent*. You're not a Brazilian football star, so you probably need both a first and last name. Please capitalize the first letters unless there's a cultural reason not to.

#### Professional Email

Please no *rippedandsultry@example.com* or AOL accounts, ok? Gmail is the standard choice. Personal domains are cute if you have it setup properly. The important parts are that:

1. it's one account that you're going to use everywhere and check daily
2. it isn't full of noise (daily deals, newsletters, and other bullshit) that drown out potentially important things
3. it's ideally tied to tools like a calendar that you can use for your scheduling and organization

It might feel like a big pain, but *consider starting with a new account for your new career*.

#### Denver is Your Location

You don't need to be here forever, but you're here now. On anything that asks for location you should put Denver or, worst case, Boulder if you live there at this moment. People will use your location to indicate whether it's possible to meet up in person. They'll also use it to figure out your timezone when proposing times to talk/meet.

### Setup GitHub

GitHub is the root of the worldwide programmers network. You've got an account, but that isn't enough.

* Open your [account settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile)
* Set your name to the standard name you've chosen
* Set your public email to one you regularly check
* Write a bio along the lines of "Front-End Engineering Student"
* For company just write "@turingschool"
* Location is "Denver, CO"
* Might as well click the "Available for hire" checkbox :)

Save that and move to the `Emails` tab:

* Setup your primary email address if necessary
* We recommend you change the Email Preference to "Only receive account related emails, and those I subscribe to."
* Save it

While you're in there, check out the `Notification` tab. Make your own choices here, but we recommend removing the two "Watching" checks.

You're done with GitHub!
