title:  Identity Essentials

As you progress through Turing and slingshot into a developer career, your online identity is incredibly valuable and important to you.

Here in your early days of Turing you are under great pressure and pulled in several directions. Let's focus on establishing the *essentials* of your developer identity, then in later modules really build it out when you have great work to show off.

## The Why

Software development likes to think of itself as a meritocracy, but it's not. It's a relationship-driven field. To form relationships you need to be a person. When I meet you at a meetup and later google your name, I need to find you. I need to know that the result I find on LinkedIn is the same person I find on GitHub. I need to find your email address easily to send you a follow up. I want to stumble on your StackOverflow conversations to learn that you're a great communicator.

On the negative side, what if I can't find you? What if I get to your LinkedIn but think I must have been wrong -- you're not a developer you're still doing your old job? Or I get to your GitHub and there are subtle little signals you're not a *"real developer"*?

Let's do it right.

## Expectations

At the end of the module your portfolio will include a "Professional Skills" section. Tasks here contribute to the the expectations of that portfolio, including:

1. GitHub account properly setup
2. LinkedIn account properly setup
3. StackOverflow account properly setup

This shouldn't take a ton of work. Let's get into it.

## Essential Tasks

### Prep

Here's what you'll need to have on hand:

#### Headshot

We take one for you for a reason. If I look at this headshot I need to easily be able to recognize you in real life. That means it should be clear, recent, reasonably professional.

#### Standard Name

Government name, what your mama calls you, common name (so, Geoff instead of Geoffrey. Not "Shorty" or "Stinky")? It doesn't really matter as long as it's *consistent*. You're not a Brazilian football star, so you probably need both a first and last name. Please capitalize the first letters unless there's a cultural reason not to.

#### Professional Email

Please no *rippedandsultry@example.com* or AOL accounts, ok? Gmail is the standard choice. Personal domains are cute if you have it setup properly. The important parts are that:

1. it's one account that you're going to use everywhere and check daily
2. it isn't full of noise (daily deals, newsletters, and other bullshit) that drown out potentially important things
3. it's ideally tied to tools like a calendar that you can use for your scheduling and organization

It might feel like a big pain, but *consider starting with a new account for your new career*.

#### Denver is Your Location

You don't need to be here forever, but you're here now. On anything that asks for location you should put Denver or, worst case, Boulder if you live there at this moment. People will use your location to indicate whether it's possible to meet up in person. They'll also use it to figure out your timezone when proposing times to talk/meet.

### Setup GitHub

GitHub is the root of the worldwide programmers network. You've got an account, but that isn't enough.

* Open your [account settings page](https://github.com/settings/profile)
* Set your name to the standard name you've chosen
* Set your public email to one you regularly check
* Write a bio along the lines of "Front-End Engineering Student"
* For company just write "@turingschool"
* Location is "Denver, CO"
* Swap out the default github avatar with your standard headshot photo
* Might as well click the "Available for hire" checkbox :)

Save that and move to the `Emails` tab:

* Setup your primary email address if necessary
* We recommend you change the Email Preference to "Only receive account related emails, and those I subscribe to."
* Save it

While you're in there, check out the `Notification` tab. Make your own choices here, but we recommend removing the two "Watching" checks.

You're done with GitHub!

### Setup LinkedIn

You don't have to like LinkedIn, but you do have to use it. Many developers complain that all they get from LinkedIn is "recruiter spam" which translates to "people knocking down your door with job offers." That is perhaps the most privileged of problems and one you should invite into your life.

* Login and go to your profile page
* Click the "Edit Your Public Profile" link
* Make sure your standard name is setup
* Make sure your photo is your standard headshot photo
* Set a title along the lines of "Software Developer" or "Front-End Developer"
* Backfill your education and work experience if you haven't added that before

Lia suggests that:

* Consider a title like "Software Developer \| Former Graphic Designer" to emphasize certain parts of your background
* If you're looking to move to a certain location for work, consider using that as your LinkedIn location to get noticed by recruiters there
* Add a "Summary": this is your opportunity to tell your story and call out that you're a career changer. which makes a big impact on recruiters. The first 100 characters show up on the recruiter view, if they aren't caught by it they donâ€™t click through

#### Turing Education

Then add Turing under education. You want to add something along these lines:

* School: Turing School of Software & Design
* Field of Study: "Back-End Engineering" or "Front-End Engineering"
* Time period: 2017-2017
* Location: Denver, CO

You can tweak the description as you see fit, but here are some ideas:

```
Turing students invest over 1500 hours across seven months in becoming job-ready software developers. In the Front-End Engineering program we begin by building skills in HTML, CSS, and Design Fundamentals. We continue by laying a solid foundation in core JavaScript, then progress into React. In the final quarter students build backend applications with Node and SQL. In total, FEE graduates have the skills to turn design comps into working applications.
```

Or a back-end take:

```
Turing students invest over 1500 hours across seven months in becoming job-ready software developers. In the Back-End Engineering program we begin by building skills in object-oriented programming and design. We continue by building full-stack Rails applications, then moving into providing and consuming APIs.  In the final quarter students layer on the fundamentals of JavaScript, build with React, while mixing in other production techniques like message queues, continuous integration, and agile project management. In total, BEE graduates have the skills to turn HTML and CSS templates into production-ready applications.
```

Revisions/suggestions/pull requests on those are welcome.

Save that and you're done with LinkedIn.

### Setup StackOverflow

We want to get better at question asking and answering. There's a big world out there outside of Turing, and a lot of the Q&A activity happens on StackOverflow.

Getting your StackOverflow setup is probably the easiest of the three:

* Create an account
* Edit your profile
* Set your standard head shot
* Set your display name to your standard name
* Put Denver in your location
* For title, use "Student at Turing School"
* About Me is optional
* Add your twitter username if you have one
* Add your GitHub user name
* "Career" Section: "school", "Student", "Turing School of Software & Design"
* Save your profile

You'd be surprised how many employers look at your StackOverflow account. Maybe you decide to integrate the *answering* of questions into your daily or weekly routines?

## Optional Tasks

The above are necessary, the below are if-you-feel-like-it but useful.

### Setup Twitter

Twitter is where the public dialog of the programming community happens. It's a great way to keep track of what issues people are talking about, new releases, etc.

A rich twitter experience typically means following 500-1500 accounts. You don't need to read every tweet.

[Here's a list-in-progress of a few people you might want to check out](https://twitter.com/j3/lists/starter-set/members).

Setup your account with your proper name and that same standard headshot photo. In your bio say something like "Front-End Engineering student at @turingschool".

### Setup Medium

Every developer at some point has the temptation to write their own blog engine. The foolish ones do it.

Please don't be that person. Just use Medium. Signup for an account. When you've written 20 articles and feel the platform is "holding you back," then you can go try some other tool. But don't let tool obsession become an excuse to avoid actually writing a few blog posts.

If you had a medium page with six solid articles by the time you start job hunting it'll be a significant asset for you.

Make sure it's got that right name, headshot, and bio.
