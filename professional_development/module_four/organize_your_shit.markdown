*Precheck*: Before you dive into this, you should carefully complete the [Identity Essentials](backend.turing.io/professional_development/module_one/identity_essentials) tutorial.

Your success in both job hunting and succeeding on in that job will boil down to:

**Discipline** + **Hustle** + **Skill**

* Your *skills* have grown and continue to grow as you near graduation. That's easy.
* *Hustle* comes easily for some and is difficult for others. We'll continue to talk about that.
* But today we're focused on *discipline*.

## On Discipline

Discipline is not about conformity. The purposes of discipline are:

1. High-output, high-quality work
2. Decrease anxiety
3. Increase happiness

### "Yeah, I'm fine."

There have been many to walk this road before you. There are several who have the technical
skills but the job hunt takes forever. The consequences are real:

1. Lost income/savings
2. Depression
3. Self-induced isolation from peers and Turing community
4. Mediocre final job if/when it comes together

If you approach the job hunt casually these will be your results.

### Our Brains

[David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)) says "the human brain is for *creating* ideas, not *remembering* them."

[Kathy Sierra](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat) argues that by sapping our cognitive resources, our tools can make us dumb and fat.

*Discipline* means letting go. Letting go of what your brain is bad at. Letting it do what it's meant to -- and using other systems to solve the mundane problems.

## Problems to Solve

You've been here in the nest of Turing for months. We've told you what to do, when to do it, and whether or not it's done correctly. Now you're entering uncertainty and you need to fly on your own.

### Your Commitment-Brain

You need a calendar. You need to use it. Multiple times per day. A calendar system needs to be accessible from multiple devices (your phone, computer, etc) and able to import/subscribe to outside data sources.

The *goal* of using a calendar is for it to be your *external brain* responsible for time commitments. You should put *every time-based activity* on your calendar.

Google Calendar is pretty good and perhaps the most ubiquitous. If you don't have a strong preference for something else, use it.

Once you have an account setup, open your module calendar in a browser, click the `[+] Google Calendar` icon in the bottom right, and add it to your Google Calendar.

Now you'll generally know when your class commitments and work times are. Notice that work times in the afternoons -- a great time to schedule phone calls and interviews.

What else do you need to have on your regular calendar? **Everything.** Do you workout at certain times? Call your mom? Attend a posse meetup? Take time to meditate? Add them to the calendar.

**Take the extra moment to setup appropriate *repeat* settings so recurring commitments are automatically there.** If your have to *remember* to add regular events then you're wasting your cognitive resources.

And what about the *job hunt*? Decide *when* you're going to do the work. Is it every day 8:00-8:30? Tuesday and Thursday 7-9pm? If you're in Mod 3 it should probably be 2-4 hours/week. Mod 4 it should probably be closer to 4-6 hours/week. After you graduate it should be 60 hours/week.

**Right now** put down some recurring, reserved time to work on finding a job.

### Your Timing-Brain

Remember pomodoros? The "pomodoro technique" probably just means "25 minutes on, 5 off" to you.

**That's not the point.** Take a [quick read through this primer](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730).

The Pomodoro Technique is about **purposefully controlling your attention**.

Why do marathon runners keep track of speed? Just run until you're tired, then keep going, right? Does it sound stupid? Isn't that how you normally approach you work? Run until it's done or you collapse?

By purposefully controlling your attention, keeping it at a sustainable pace with careful breaks, you can dramatically increase the amount of work you get done.

Pick a timer. Right now. [This app seems fine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoro-timer-focus-on-your/id872515009?mt=12). There are web apps and mobile apps. Pick something and stick with it.

Before you begin work you decide on a timebox for how long it's allowed to go. When that time is over the activity is over. When you're working your timer is running. *When it stops, you stop*.

#### Fuck Notifications

We're witnessing a world rip itself apart though the manipulation of attention. Your attention is valuable, like $$$ valuable, and other people want to control it. Your attention is the prerequisite for work and fun. **Don't spread it around.**

Open your MacOS System Preferences then the Notification panel. Turn on "Do Not Disturb" from "12:01 AM" to "11:59 PM". Also check the next two boxes.

Go into your phone's preferences. For iOS, Settings > Notifications. Walk through each application and turn the notifications **OFF**. Allow them for Text Messages. If your friends/fam text you during your work time just leave them for later.

Go into your GitHub profile. Turn off the incessant email notifications unless you've been @mentioned.

Please, please, please turn off your Slack notifications. If you must, allow notifications for DMs. That's it. *If you're getting notifications when messages are posted into a channel you are throwing your attention in the garbage can*.

Consider cutting down noise in your email inbox by [using a mass-unsubscribe tool like Unroll.me](https://unroll.me/).

### Your Data-Brain

You finally have meetings. Maybe interviews. Code challenges. You write questions before an interview.

You need all that data safe, accessible, and searchable.

You're a nerd so you're thinking about git. A git repo is fine. But it's really hard to beat [Evernote](https://evernote.com/). You don't have to worry about committing, it's cloud-backed-up, and works great on your phone.

*Setup an Evernote account if you don't already have one.* Decide that this is where you're going to put all data related to job hunting. Take notes whenever you talk to people, in person or on the phone. I like to take notes on paper, then in Evernote summarize the important parts and take a photo of the note pages in case I want more details.

You'll always think you'll remember. What did you talk about? Who did you talk with? What was their last name again? Where was their LinkedIn profile? Did they say that had kids? We into Elixir? **Dump the data out of your thinking-brain into your data-brain: Evernote.**

### Your Task-Brain

Last piece of the puzzle, you need a place to track both the things you do once and those you do on an interval.

I'm a [big fan of Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front). The RPG thing is silly and maybe you'll enjoy it. But the important part are the to-do tracking mechanics.

**Habits** are the things you want to encourage yourself to do. Some of mine tracked in Habitica are "In bed by 10pm" and "Finish & Refill Big Water Bottle". Little things that help me do my best work.

**Dailies** are one of the unique parts of Habitica that I haven't seen in other apps. What things do you want to do every day? What about every weekday? Every Wednesday and Friday? You can set dailies to repeat on different calendar. I have a "daily" to take out the trash cans that only appears on Sundays. Meanwhile "Take vitamins" is every day. More work-related, I have an every-weekday task to "Review yesterday's notes for new to-dos" and "Review calendar for conflicts and heads-up". I do those first thing each morning and check the boxes.

Finally, traditional *To-Dos*. I think the to-do list is the weakest part of Habitica. I wish there were support for two or three lists, starring/highlighting, etc. But the Habits and Dailies make the app worth it. One important part of the to-dos: they're like software stories -- the shorter the better. Writing five short to-dos is always going to be better than one big one.

Note that for all three categories you can adjust the difficulty/weighting. I get more points for "30 Minutes of Exercise" then I do for "Read for 10 Minutes".

Poke around Habitica and you can find a Turing Student guild. It adds on a social component that can actually be pretty important. It's been late at night and I'm doing push-ups so my Turing staffmates don't lose HPs because I missed a daily. Your party doesn't see your tasks, just whether you're getting things done or missing tasks.

Lastly, it's an open-source Node/Angular app. Maybe you want to make a contribution?

## Do the Work

At this point you're probably thinking "I don't need all that" or "that's not for me." I know, I know. But I'm telling you to do it anyway.

**Get all this in place ASAP.** Use it. Encourage your pairs to use it. If this is "community-driven education," then why approach this difficult phase alone? Check-in with each other. Setup regular job work times. Even if you're just sitting next to each other. Hold each other accountable for the big things and the little things, like managing you attention.

Help us hit our big hiring goals for 2017 but, more importantly, get yourself an awesome job.

*Lastly, here's a wager*:

If you get to 30-days out from graduation, you've done what we've asked in ProSkills, you've used the techniques and tools I've laid out here regularly, and you *still* don't have at least one job offer, I'll buy you lunch and we'll brainstorm/investigate what's going wrong.
