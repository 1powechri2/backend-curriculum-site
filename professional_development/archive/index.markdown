### Personal Branding I
Who are you? How did you get here? Learning how to tell your story is important for successfully conveying how you’ll contribute to a team. Think about how you’d like to contribute your prior experience and career to the tech community. How would you like to use your skills as a software developer? In this workshop, we’ll discuss how to tell your story through different channels -- software teams, resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Github -- and how these tie together to support your job search.

### Personal Branding II
Using the lessons learned of how you work best and how to communicate that with your teams, this session provides you with the tools to assess your personal branding collateral. You'll analyze how your story is received across different mediums, where it needs improvement, and how it can be tied together with your personal site.
