Professional development in Module One is focused on the fundamentals of building a career as a developer:

## [Identity Essentials](identity_essentials)

In [this exercise](identity_essentials) you'll setup basic prerequisites of being a software developer on the internet, including your GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow accounts.

## [Learning to Pair](learning_to_pair)

Understanding how to successfully work in teams is crucial to being a successful developer. At Turing, we emphasize pair and team programming as it is an industry norm. [In this session](learning_to_pair), you'll learn how to communicate with each other and define your working relationships with pairs, discuss strategies for how to hold each other accountable to these expectations, and how to address broken expectations.

## [Feedback I](feedback_1)

Giving and receiving feedback effectively is difficult -- emotions run high and it can be hard to process what's said. [In this session](feedback_1) we'll discuss our awareness of/reactions to feedback, then dive into the three types of feedback, when they're needed, and how to solicit them. We'll discuss a framework for how to successfully have a feedback conversation, culminating in an understanding of how to move forward with your personal improvement.
