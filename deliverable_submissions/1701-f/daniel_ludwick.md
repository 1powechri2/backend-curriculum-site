## Mod 2 Deliverables:
# Mentor Outreach

* Name of contact
  * The mentor (or alum) I contacted was Mark Miranda.

* Date of contact
  * 03/30/2017

* Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

  *  I had reached out to several mentors. Mark was the first to respond with a viable schedule and capablity to be a mentor. We met for lunch, decided it was a good match, and have met up several times since then.

* How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development? 

  * The best benefit will be having someone outside of class/school that I can focus specific question and concerns with. This will help me keep my head above the water while I'm at school.
