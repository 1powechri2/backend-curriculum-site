# Student PD Deliverable Submissions

To submit your deliverables, click on the folder for your cohort. Students should update their individual file with links to specific deliverables before making a Pull Request. 

If feedback is needed for a deliverable, you'll hear from Allison or Meg with information on what needs to be updated before a deliverable is considered final. If you don't hear from Allison or Meg, you can assume that your deliverable was accepted.
