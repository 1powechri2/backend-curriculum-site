##### Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: 
* I think that is important to research interview questions and write out some answers prior to the interview. It is also improtant to ask yourself challenging questions, and practice speaking your response. It's kind of like preparing for a speech, but you don't want to seem overly rehearsed or "salesy". Also practicing coding challenges is good too.
