* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: 
    - Be prepared to ask questions (both if you get stuck on a challenge, and for general conversation).
    - If you mess up the technical interview, take the problem home, finish it, and submit your solution.
    - Ask about blockchains!
    - Research the company in advance.
    - Don't arrive early. Well, arrive early, but don't enter the building till interview time.
