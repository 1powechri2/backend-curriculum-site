## Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?

I listen to what my other team mates are saying, and if I'm confused I ask questions. 

* How do you use your strengths as a team member?

I'm upbeat and I encourage people to work on projects. I'm easy to talk to. 

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?

I can study and practice until I have confidence in my ability. I can speak up more when 

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 

My confidence in my skill. I want to be more assertive, even if it's areas I'm not 100% about. I need to trust that I have the ability to find the right answers.  

* How would you like your teammates to see you?

Confident. Helpful. Hardworking. I want to really contribute on any team I'm on, not drag them down.
