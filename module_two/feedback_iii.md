### Session Structure

Length: 90 minutes

* Opening (5 mins)
* Feedback Review (12 mins)
* Right & Wrong Spotting (20 mins)
* Johari Windows & Personal Reflections (30 mins; 20 mins. on Johari Windows, 10 mins. on personal reflection)
* Appreciative Inquiry (25 mins.)
* Closing (5 mins.)


Johari Windows/Personal Reflections (20 mins sorting through JW, 10 mins on personal reflection -- knowing they will be coached)

Appreciative Inquiry (30 mins)
  Discuss 5D approach to appreciative inquiry -- using this to unearth ways you can apply the feedback you've been given
  Coach each other based on what you've discovered during your reflections
 

### Why
In your third and final feedback session, we'll spend time reflecting on how we can find meaning in the feedback we receive and make concrete action plans for how to improve our practices and behaviors. 

What value is there in using feedback for personal growth? Why is this something we're talking about at Turing?

* Whole Group Discussion

### Objectives

* 
* Apply Appreciative Inquiry coaching techniques to group coaching

### Deliverable
Use your Johari Windows and coaching practice today to complete [this reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md) in a gist to submit via the [PD deliverables submission repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions).

### Opening
Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?

* Whole group discussion
* Discuss objectives and deliverable

### Feedback Tests Our Growth Mindsets
Review: what is a growth mindset? How do you think feedback might affect a growth mindset?

Pulse Check: How much does this sound like you? Reflect in your journals on these statements:

| To What Degree is this Me? | Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often, Always |
| ------ | ---------------- | 
| I love feedback. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 | 
| I recognize when I have feedback triggers. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I separate how I'm feeling from the feedback. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I view tough situations as learning opportunities. | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |
| I reward myself when I get something helpful from feedback because of the way I handled it.  | 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 |

**Turn & Talk:** 
Turn to the person next to you to discuss your reflections on the above statements. How do you and your partner feel similarly or differently about these statements?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* What did you and your partner have in common about these statements?
* How did you differ?
* Based on this discussion, where would you like to see a change in your attitude towards feedback?

### Right & Wrong Spotting
When we receive feedback, often our first reaction is that it's wrong or unhelpful. That's a valid feeling resulting from a trigger and the impact that the feedback has on you -- go with it. Pay attention to why you're having this impact. 

**In the moment:**
Hone in on your internal voice to pay attention to what could be triggering you

| Internal Voice | Listen For: | Ask: |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| TRUTH<br>That’s wrong.<br>That’s not helpful.<br>That’s not me | **Data** they have that I don’t and
interpretations they have that are different from mine<br>**Impacts** I’m hearing that I may not be
aware of because of my blind spots | Can you give me an example?<br>What did that mean to you?<br>What are your concerns?<br>What do you see me doing that’s getting in my own way?<br>How did that affect you? |


**Upon further reflection:**
Use the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to turn the feedback into something useful. Start by listing everything that seems wrong about the feedback. And then go back through the feedback and pull out what might be *right* about it -- what truth is there in this feedback? What is something that you can easily implement?

| Wrong | Right |
| ------ | ---------------- | 
| What do I not agree with about this feedback? | What is something right that I can use from this feedback? |

#### I Do
Allison will model how she would use the Right & Wrong Spotting technique to parse through feedback.

#### You Do
Spend 

  How this relates to triggers
  Examples with internal voices
    Talk through examples with a partner & then share
  Work time: Spend time reflecting on feedback that you've gotten; create a right and wrong spotting column and writing out any questions that you need to ask
