[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iLKN-7mCeQCaYulVT_LOsC4ctKjVgG63fNBRijtf33E/edit?usp=sharing)

### Objectives
* 

### Deliverable

Have a feedback conversation and document it using these guidelines....

### Opening
Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?

* Whole group discussion
* Discuss objectives and deliverable

### Intent vs. Impact
Every dialogue includes *intent* and *impact*. The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. 

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Be more confident | When you don't know something, be confident enough to admit it. | You should give others the impression that you have all the answers |

#### Whole Group Discussion
What kind of feedback is the giver providing here? Reminder - the 3 types of feedback are:

* Appreciation
* Coaching
* Evaluation

* What other impacts might this feedback have?
* How might you reframe the feedback thinking about the impact that it might have?

Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include:

* Your facial expressions
* Your tone of voice
* Your behavior patterns

How could blind spots potentially affect the intent of a feedback giver's words?

#### Small Group Discussions 
Create groups of 3-4 students to discuss the feedback and its intent and impact below.  

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Your opinions come across... | Consider other people's points of view | Tone down your enthusiasm. Be bland and passive |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| You received a 4 on testing again this project | Few people ever get a 5, and you got a 4 twice in a row. This is impressive! | I worked even harder than last project, and I still got a 4. No one is noticing my hard work.

**Discussion Questions:**
For each piece of feedback, answer these questions:

* What kind of feedback is this?
* How might you reframe this feedback considering the impact?
* We're thinking about this feedback knowing what the impact is already. How can you be more aware of impact while phrasing your feedback?

### Communicating Feedback 
Ask for the type of feedback you want - and prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. 

Review how to conduct a feedback conversation:
Open the conversation by getting aligned
4 skills
Discuss active listening -- TED talk?
Close by committing to action


How to have this conversation as a group retro vs. 1-on-1


### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations
Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations. 


Prep for conversations (6 mins)
* BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)
Have the conversations (10 mins)
Discuss what feedback they’re looking for and the expectations for how they want to give and receive feedback
Feedback on the projects so far and how they expect to finish the project
Be prepared to have a full retro conversation

### Next steps (5 mins)
* As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template]( on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*

* Complete a personal reflection:
    * What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? 
    * In a year from now, if you’re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?
