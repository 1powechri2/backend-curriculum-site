[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iLKN-7mCeQCaYulVT_LOsC4ctKjVgG63fNBRijtf33E/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure

* Opening
* 

### Objectives
* Understand how intent and impact affect dialogue
* Discover how blind spots affect your abilities to give and receive feedback
* Practice active listening and reframing feedback
* Deliver feedback in a constructive conversation

### Deliverable

Have a feedback conversation and document it using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

### Opening
Why is working on our skills for giving and receiving feedback so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?

* Whole group discussion
* Discuss objectives and deliverable

Last module, we focused on giving written feedback. Today, we'll discuss techniques for providing feedback in a face-to-face conversation. 

### Review: Intent vs. Impact
Whole Group Review:

* What do we mean by *intent* and *impact*?
    The intent (the purpose behind the giver's message) may not always align with its impact (how the receiver is affected by the message) in conversation. 

Turn & Talk: 
* How might intent and impact function differently in a verbal conversation vs. written feedback? 
* What are some norms you might want to set when having an in-person feedback conversation in order to more fully align your intent with your impact?

2-3 groups share out. 

EXAMPLE??
Every dialogue includes *intent* and *impact*. 

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Be more confident | When you don't know something, be confident enough to admit it. | You should give others the impression that you have all the answers |

#### Whole Group Discussion
What kind of feedback is the giver providing here? Reminder - the 3 types of feedback are:

* Appreciation
* Coaching
* Evaluation

* What other impacts might this feedback have?
* How might you reframe the feedback thinking about the impact that it might have?



### Review: Blind Spots....
Blind spots are always present as a gap between the self we think we present and the self that others see. Even with good intentions, your thoughts and feelings can affect the impact of your communication through behaviors that you don't always notice. These can include:

* Your facial expressions
* Your tone of voice
* Your behavior patterns

How could blind spots potentially affect the intent of a feedback giver's words?

#### Small Group Discussions 
Create groups of 3-4 students to discuss the feedback and its intent and impact below.  

| Feedback | Giver's Intent | Giver's Impact |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Don't be so quick to make a decision without talking to others | Consider other people's points of view when making a decision | Don't think for yourself. Tone down your enthusiasm. Be bland and passive |
| You're making a lot of strides with TDD. You got a 4 on testing again this project | Few people ever get a 5, and you got a 4 twice in a row. This is impressive! | I worked even harder than last project, and I still got a 4. No one is noticing my hard work. |

**Discussion Questions:**
For each piece of feedback, answer these questions:

* What kind of feedback is this?
* How might you reframe this feedback considering the impact?
* We're thinking about this feedback knowing what the impact is already. How can you be more aware of impact while phrasing your feedback?

### Switchtracking



#### Small Group Discussions


### Communicating Feedback 
Ask for the type of feedback you want - and prime yourself for triggers that could arise in response to it. 

Review how to conduct a feedback conversation:
* **Open** the conversation by getting aligned
   * Define the purpose of the conversation
   * What kind of feedback are we discussing?
   * What does the giver want to give me?
   * Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?
* **Body:** Two-way exchange of information
   * Listening
   * Asserting
   * Managing conversation process
   * Problem-solving
* **Close** by committing to action

What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?

An important skill from the body part is listening. What does it mean to actively listen? What can make it difficult to really listen to someone?



How to Mitigate Switchtracking: Set Boundaries...



#### Read, Pair, Share
Read through these [5 steps for improving listening skills](https://www.fastcompany.com/3036026/5-ways-to-improve-your-listening-skills)

Then pair up with someone else to have a short conversation. Describe to your partner a recent concept that you've learned at Turing and what that experience was like for you. Your partner will practice active listening and repeat back what they've heard from you.

**Takeaways:** 
* What went well for you in this practice?
* What will you need to be aware of as you continue working on your listening skills?

### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations
Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations:

* BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)
* Write down any key points, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from the other 
* This is one conversation on how the project is going so far and how you want to finish it, but consider any feedback that will need to be discussed after the project is over

### Next steps
* As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md) on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*

* Complete a personal reflection:
    * What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? 
    * In a year from now, if youâ€™re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?
