[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iLKN-7mCeQCaYulVT_LOsC4ctKjVgG63fNBRijtf33E/edit?usp=sharing)

### Objectives
* 

### Deliverable

Have a feedback conversation and document it using these guidelines....

### Opening
Recap principles of giving good feedback, triggers and things to be aware of
3 mins: Why is working on our giving and receiving feedback skills so important? Why have we chosen this as a skill for you to work on in your career development at Turing?
Solicit answers first from students
Then show them the reasons and discuss objectives and deliverable

start with intent vs. impact and then show different examples of how feedback can go wrong through roleplaying -- I demonstrate with student volunteers (don’t do all the terms but more about demonstrating the meat of what to be aware of) -- (15 mins)

### Communicating Feedback (20 mins)
Asking for the type of feedback you need to hear/prime yourself
March inning -- some of this is review
Open the conversation by getting aligned
4 skills
Discuss active listening -- TED talk?
Close by committing to action
How to have this conversation as a group retro vs. 1-on-1


### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations

Prep for conversations (6 mins)
* BE: Bike Share (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)
Have the conversations (10 mins)
Discuss what feedback they’re looking for and the expectations for how they want to give and receive feedback
Feedback on the projects so far and how they expect to finish the project
Be prepared to have a full retro conversation

### Next steps (5 mins)
* As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template]( on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*

* Complete a personal reflection:
    * What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? What will you need to be aware of to overcome that challenge? 
    * In a year from now, if you’re practicing these conversations regularly, how will your communication skills have changed?
