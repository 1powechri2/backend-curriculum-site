# Cold Outreach I

### Objectives
* Understand why cold outreach is effective for establishing professional relationships
* Implement strategies to contact mentors, alumni, and/or professional contacts who you'd like to meet
* 

### Deliverable
You'll be expected to give a synopsis of your cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i_guidelines.md) via the [PD submissions repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions)

### Opening
In the technology industry, moreso than in other industries, getting ahead in your career comes down to who you know. Establishing strong connections with those in the technology community starts while you're at Turing.

This is the first of two sessions about outreach. While this session is called Cold Outreach, we'll be looking at contacts within the Turing community, so this is more of "warm outreach," and it will give you experience and confidence to be able to build on your network and intiate true cold outreach during Module 4. Thus, your first objective as part of your networking practice is to make connections with others in the Turing community by utilizing our extensive mentorship community. 

### The Why
**Why should I reach out to mentors?** 
For one, they are already a part of your community here and can provide a wealth of knowledge to you not only on how to be successful at Turing but important information on entering the software industry. They also **want** you to reach out to them -- they've volunteered to be a part of the mentorship program. 

**Why cold outreach? Why can't mentors just be assigned to students?** 
First, we don't have the bandwidth to assign mentors. And even if we did, who's to say we'd create the best match for you? Learning how to reach out to others and create a network is an important skill for you to be successful in this industry, and it is also how you'll create the most meaningful relationships possible. 

### Finding the Right People
The strategies discussed here can be applied to reaching out to anyone, but again, we'll focus on mentors in this particular session. Before you start reaching out to just anyone, ask yourself "what would I like to get out of a mentor relationship?"

Possible answers:

* Project help
* Drills and homework help
* Learning about the industry
* Technical and/or behavioral prep
* Emotional support 
* Learning about specific jobs/companies
* Learning about the tech scene in a certain location

Answering these questions could lead you to a long list of ideas -- this is totally fine. But take time to prioritize your needs that are the most pressing right now. Start with that highest priority. 

Now, go to the [mentorship spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxsATOSIdRZ78-Bj3GQY2LkIp0OV_sCN6GJVjtUuCl0/edit?usp=sharing) to find 1-3 people who fit your answer(s). 

Other things to keep in mind:

* Is your contact in Denver or remote?
* Does their schedule match up with yours?

Have an idea of how you would set up a meeting with a mentor before you contact them. 

### Actual Email Formatting
When you're ready to write your email, here are some things to keep in mind:

**Less is More:**

* Keep it short
* 3-5 sentences is best practice
* Be direct and make it easy for them -- can they respond to you in one sentence?

**Email Format:**

* Keep it casual -- no "To Whom It May Concern" 
* Draw a connection between you and the person on the receiving end -- why did you pick that person to reach out to?
* Don't tell your life stroy. That can come when you actually meet the person. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point
* Utilize the subject line

**Email Purpose:**

What do you want to talk about? Go back to your highest priorities listed above.

When you're ready to apply this to industry contacts, you may also consider:

* Informational interviews
* Visit their company and tour their office
* Company's process for hiring junior developers

**Examples**:

    Hi Jose,

    My name is ____, and I'm a module two student in the _____ program at Turing. I'm originally from Chicago 
    and would love to move back there after I graduate. I'd really like to connect with you to discuss your 
    work and the tech scene in Chicago. I'm particularly interested in any advice you have for me during the 
    rest of the program at Turing for how I can prepare for my job search and how I could get started in Chicago. 
    I noticed on your schedule that you are available Wednesdays at 5pm -- are you free next Tuesday the 28th? 
    Here's the Google Hangout link we can use. If that date/time doesn't work for you, let me know a time that's
    better for you. 

    Thanks,
    Gaby Martinez

    Hi Jenna,
    I'm reaching out because I'm currently in Mod Two of the _____ program at Turing, and I saw that you work 
    in React. I'm about to dive into React more in my projects and would really appreciate any guidance you 
    might be able to give me. And since you've been through the program too, I'd like to hear about your 
    experience at Turing and any advice you might have   on how to be successful. Are you be available to meet
    for coffee this Thursday (6/2) at 4pm at Dazbog off of Curtis and 18th?

    Thanks,

### What Not to Do
It's definitely exciting (or excruciating, depending on your initial viewpoint) to reach out to someone new from the industry. But make sure you don't let your nerves get the best of you. 

### Reminders
* The mentors **want** to hear from you!
* You can create more than one mentor relationship
* 


### Research & Execution Time

* If you haven't looked at the mentor sheet yet, spend time researching who you'd like to reach out to and then craft a message

* If you have already been meeting with a mentor regularly, find someone else from the sheet to reach out to based on your professional interests. Draft your email following the strategies above.

### Closing & Next Steps
Reminder of how this fits into overall narrative of PD and next steps -- you'll be expected to complete your deliverable, and you're also expected to start building a network from contacts available at Turing. 

One of your deliverables in Module 4 is to write cold outreach emails to contacts from companies you're interested in. Use these strategies to build your comfort in cold outreach so that you'll be prepared to take the next step of applying them to your job search.
