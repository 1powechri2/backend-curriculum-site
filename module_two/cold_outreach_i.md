# Cold Outreach I
This session plays a part in your professional development at Turing by providing you with 

### Objectives
* Understand why cold outreach is effective for establishing professional relationships
* Implement strategies to contact mentors, alumni, and/or professional contacts who you'd like to meet
* 

### Deliverable
You'll be expected to give a synopsis of your cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i_guidelines.md)

### Opening
In the technology industry, moreso than in other industries, getting ahead in your career comes down to who you know. Establishing strong connections with those in the technology community starts while you're at Turing.

This is the first of two sessions about outreach. While this session is called Cold Outreach, we'll be looking at contacts within the Turing community, so this is more of "warm outreach," and it will give you experience and confidence to be able to build on your network and intiate true cold outreach during Module 4. Thus, your first objective as part of your networking practice is to make connections with others in the Turing community by utilizing our extensive mentorship community. 

### The Why
Why should you reach out to mentors or alumni? For one, they are already a part of your community here. 

Why cold outreach? Why can't mentors just be assigned to students? Because you'll need to reach out to people

### Finding the Right People
The strategies discussed here can be applied to reaching out to anyone, but again, we'll focus on mentors in this particular session. Before you start reaching out to just anyone, ask yourself "what would I like to get out of a mentor relationship?"

Possible answers:

* Project help
* Drills and homework help
* Learning about the industry
* Technical and/or behavioral prep
* Emotional support 
* Learning about specific jobs/companies
* Learning about the tech scene in a certain location

Now, go to the [mentorship spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxsATOSIdRZ78-Bj3GQY2LkIp0OV_sCN6GJVjtUuCl0/edit?usp=sharing) to find 1-3 people who fit your answer(s). 

Other things to keep in mind:

* Is your contact in Denver or remote?
* Does their schedule match up with yours?
* 

Have an idea of how you would set up a meeting with a mentor before you contact them. 

### Actual Email Formatting
When you're ready to write your email, here are some things to keep in mind:

**Less is More:**

* Keep it short
* 3-5 sentences is best practice
* Be direct and make it easy for them -- can they respond to you in one sentence?

**Email Format:**

* Keep it casual -- no "To Whom It May Concern" 


**Examples**:

Hi Sally,

My name is ____, and I'm a module two student in the _____ program at Turing. I'm originally from Seattle and would love to move back there after I graduate. 

would love to connect with you more about your work, Fission Strategy, and the tech scene in Seattle more generally.
I'm particularly interested in Fission Strategy's focus on foundations and nonprofits.
Are you available to grab coffee at Tiny Cup at 4pm next Tuesday, the 28th? If that date/time doesn't work for you, let me know a time that's better for you. 

Thanks,
Alex Ferrari

### What Not to Do
It's definitely exciting (or excruciating, depending on your initial viewpoint) to reach out to someone new from the industry. But make sure you don't let your nerves get the best of you. 

### Reminders
* The mentors **want** to hear from you!
* You can create more than one mentor relationship
* 


### Research & Execution Time

* If you haven't looked at the mentor sheet yet, spend time researching who you'd like to reach out to and then craft a message

* If you have already been meeting with a mentor regularly, find someone else from the sheet to reach out to based on your professional interests. Draft your email following the strategies above.

### Closing & Next Steps
Reminder of how this fits into overall narrative of PD and next steps -- you'll be expected to complete your deliverable, and you're also expected to start building a network from contacts available at Turing. 

One of your deliverables in Module 4 is to write cold outreach emails to contacts from companies you're interested in. Use these strategies to build your comfort in cold outreach so that you'll be prepared to take the next step of applying them to your job search.
