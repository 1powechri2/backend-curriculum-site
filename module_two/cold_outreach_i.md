# Cold Outreach I

Summary of how this fits into overall narrative here

### Objectives

### Deliverable
You'll be expected to give a synopsis of your cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines]9https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/cold_outreach_i_guidelines.md)

### Opening
In the technology industry, looking for jobs   Your first objective here is to make connections with others in the Turing community...

This is the first of two sessions about outreach. While this session is called Cold Outreach, we'll be looking at contacts within the Turing community, so this is more of "warm outreach," and it will give you experience and confidence to be able to build on your network and intiate true cold outreach during Module 4. 

### Why
Why you would reach out to mentors and/or alumni

### How do you know the right people to contact

### Research & Execution Time
Differentiation:
* If you haven't looked at the mentor sheet yet, spend time researching who would be interesting to reach out to

* If you have already been meeting with a mentor regularly, find someone else from the sheet to reach out to based on your professional interests. Draft your email following the strategies above

### Closing & Next Steps
Reminder of how this fits into overall narrative of PD and next steps -- you'll be expected to complete your deliverable, and you're also expected to start building a network from contacts available at Turing.
