# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?

according to the jahari window results, others say (and I agree with): warm, welcoming, logical, dependable, calm, collaborative, communicative, accepting, hard-working, etc. 

* How do you use your strengths as a team member?

Seems that I've been successful in communicating well with others and helping them in their achievements, all without dominating the group. Which is my goal! 

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?

I'd like to be better at managing difficult group dynamics. When I am working with someone else who is good at collaborating, we collaborate well. (No surprise). But when I'm paired with someone who is not as good at collaborating, I think there's more I can to do add value to the situation. Maybe there's not, but I want to explore the idea.

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 

I'd like to do better at helping our group see "over the horizon" and think at a higher level about the project, instead of taking just one iteration at a time. The problem is, I cannot actually see over the horizon, so... this is a big challenge. But I'd like to achieve it either way.

* How would you like your teammates to see you?

For the most part, my team saw me as I'd like to be seen. There were few attributes that I selected that no one else did, and where there WAS lack of overlap, it was in very similar words. I.E. I put "knowledgable", and no one else selected that, but there were a few "strategic, intelligent, logical, able", etc. So, close enough for me. 

* Any other comments:
