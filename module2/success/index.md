### Final Assessment

Students must earn a score of 3 or greater in each category of the final assessment rubric.

### Blog Post

### Community Involvement

In addition to Gear Up and Posses, there are various way to contribute to the community. Students are expected to contribute in a way that most suites themselves and relay the contribution to Instructors during their portfolio review.

### Professional Development

Students are expected to contribute during the Professional Development session and deliver deliverables from that session.

### Non-Graded work

Module 2 is heavily weighted by non-graded work. Students are expected to participate in and deliver work that is not evaluated. If a student consistently ignores or does not finish the non-graded work in module 2 they may not complete the module or may be asked to complete work they did not finish before moving forward with the program.

These works include:

TaskManager, Blogger, Mix-Master, Mini-Project, JobTracker, Checks For Understanding, Other homeworks, and any other assigned but not evaluated materials.
