# Cart Exploration

- The goal of this exercise is to explore the idea of a cart in Rails.
  1. Watch [this](https://jedrekdomanski.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/building-a-shopping-cart-in-ruby-on-rails-part-1/) video .
  2. Check out a branch in `movie_mania` called `cart_exploration`.
  3. In `movie_mania`, we would like to put movies in our cart which we can eventually check out. Attempt this on your branch.
