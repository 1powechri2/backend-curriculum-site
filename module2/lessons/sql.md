title: SQL
subheading: interacting with a database
---

This workshop is centered around relational databases. The goal of this workshop is to learn how to interact with SQL, learn how to create database structure, add data to a database table, and query the data in your tables.

Here are the available workshops. (They are meant to be done in secession):

1. [Fundamental SQL](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html)
1. [SQL by repetition](http://sql-by-repetition.herokuapp.com/)
1. [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/intermediate_sql.md](Intermediate SQL)

These are all self guided and are strait forward to get up and running. As always your instructor will be around for guidance and help if you need it. Remember, if you come with a question, be sure to tell the instructor the context and what you have done so far to try to solve your problem. Good luck!

PS. When you're doing this it may be helpful to think about how ActiveRecord will do the same query.

Have Fun!
