title: SQL
---

It's time for some SQL refreshers!

Work through the following (in order):

1. [Fundamental SQL](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/sql/fundamental_sql.html) (review from intermission work)
1. [SQL by repetition](http://sql-by-repetition.herokuapp.com/)
1. [Intermediate SQL](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/intermediate_sql.md)

These are all self-guided, but as always, your instructor(s) will be around for guidance and help if you need it. Good luck!

PS. While you're doing this it may be helpful to think about how ActiveRecord would execute the same query.
