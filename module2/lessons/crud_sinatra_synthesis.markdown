### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* define CRUD in the programming sense of the word
* understand functionality to of *U*pdate and *D*elete of CRUD for a Sinatra app
* divide responsibilities between the controller, views, and models

### Warm Up

We'll go through the questions answered last night for homework [here](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/1f066fa3be100f8f18f4d31f521a3da4).

### MVC Overview

We'll talk about MVC and diagram what this looks like on the board.

### CRUD Overview

Assuming we want to create full CRUD functionality in our Sinatra app for users accessing our site through a browser, there are seven routes that we will need to define. Let's make a chart together.

(Here's a [completed chart](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfh9zmca7i7r3u4/CRUD%20%26%20Sinatra.jpg?dl=0), but don't open it until you're finished!)
