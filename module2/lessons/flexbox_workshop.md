## Warm-up

### Object Oriented Styling

## Flex Forms

## Art Time

Take five minutes to draw a basic web application form (e.g., create a new thing) in your note book. Annotate and label your form with pertinent information you observe. 

Some guiding questions:

* How many columns? 
* How many rows? 
* Does every "cell" have data? What "type"?

## Code Time

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sinatra-form-styling) and follow the instructions in the README.

### Together - 25 minutes

Using your fresh flexbox skills, let's code along and style the index page to look something like the images in the README.
