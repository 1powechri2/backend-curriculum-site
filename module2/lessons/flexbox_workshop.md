## Warm-up

## Art Time

Take five minutes to draw a simple calendar in your note book. Annotate and
label your calendar with pertinent information you observe. 

Some guiding questions:
* How many columns? 
* How many rows? 
* Does every "cell" have data? What "type"?

## Code Time

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/tmikeschu/flexendar), `cd` into it, and
run `open calendar.html`. Behold the beauty.

### Together - 15 minutes

Using your fresh flexbox skills, let's code along and style the calendar to look something like the image in the README.

  * Style HTML elements using CSS flexbox displays
  * Speak to styling in an object-oriented approach with containers and
    presenters.
  * Access and manipulate CSS from the Chrome Developer Tools.
  * Maximize the utility of semantic HTML tags with DRY CSS styling.

  styling
