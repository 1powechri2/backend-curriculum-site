# Career Development Curriculum

**Scope & Sequence visuals here**

Turing’s mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Turing’s professional development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on unlocking students’ potential in modules one and two through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules three and four, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers by building competencies for industry leadership and the ability to secure a fulfilling career -- and not just another job. 

The touchstones of this curriculum include these mindsets: 

* Agency: Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* Empathy: Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them 
* Engagement: Active participation in community
* Grit: A combination of perseverance and passion
* Growth: A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

Through this development, upon graduation, students will be able to communicate who they are and what they know, collaborate with teams, adapt to changing situations, execute their ideas, and solve problems as junior software developers.
